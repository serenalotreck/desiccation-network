       " 'abstract': 'Desiccation tolerance has evolved recurrently across diverse land plant lineages as an adaptation for survival in regions where seasonal rainfall drives periodic drying of vegetative tissues. Growing interest in this phenomenon has fueled recent physiological, biochemical, and genomic insights into the mechanistic basis of desiccation tolerance. Although, desiccation tolerance is often viewed as binary and monolithic, substantial variation exists in the phenotype and underlying mechanisms across diverse lineages, heterogeneous populations, and throughout the development of individual plants. Most studies have focused on conserved responses in a subset desiccation-tolerant plants under laboratory conditions. Consequently, the variability and natural diversity of desiccation-tolerant phenotypes remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we discuss the natural variation in desiccation tolerance and argue that leveraging this diversity can improve our mechanistic understanding of desiccation tolerance. We summarize information collected from ~600 desiccation-tolerant land plants and discuss the taxonomic distribution and physiology of\\xa0desiccation responses. We point out the need to quantify natural diversity of desiccation tolerance on three scales: variation across divergent lineages, intraspecific variation across populations, and variation across tissues and life stages of an individual plant. We conclude that this variability should be accounted for in experimental designs and can be leveraged for deeper insights into the intricacies of desiccation tolerance.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Tolerance to prolonged water deficit occurs along a continuum in plants, with dehydration and desiccation tolerance representing some of the most extreme adaptations to water scarcity. Although, dehydration and desiccation tolerance presumably vary among individuals of a single species, this variability remains largely unstudied. Here, we characterized expression dynamics throughout a dehydration - rehydration timecourse in six diverse genotypes of the dioecious liverwort\\xa0Marchantia inflexa. We identified classical signatures of stress response in M. inflexa, including major changes in transcripts related to metabolism, expression of LEA and ELIP genes, and evidence of cell wall remodeling. However, we detected very little temporal synchronization of these responses across different genotypes of\\xa0M. inflexa, which may be related to genotypic variation among samples, constitutive expression of dehydration associated transcripts, the sequestration of mRNAs in ribonucleoprotein partials prior to drying, or the lower tolerance of M. inflexa relative to most bryophytes studied to date. Our characterization of intraspecific variation in expression dynamics suggests that differences in the timing of transcriptional adjustments contribute to variation among genotypes, and that developmental differences impact the relative tolerance of meristematic and differentiated tissues. This work highlights the complexity and variability of water stress tolerance and underscores the need for comparative studies that seek to characterize variation in desiccation and dehydration tolerance.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In the last decade, several works showed that even bryophytes from aquatic environments, if slowly dehydrated, can cope with desiccation in a response like the one from desert bryophytes. This led to the hypothesis that, if bryophytes from contrasting habitats can have similar responses, desiccation tolerance (DT) is partially inductive and not only constitutive as previously proposed and, therefore, colony morphology might be the key trait responsible for controlling dehydration rate essential for DT induction. Morphology and life form may be determinant traits in the adaptation of bryophytes to habitats with different water availabilities and corresponding predicted levels in the DT inducibility spectrum. Bryophytes from habitats with different water availabilities were dried as individual shoots and as a colony. The bryophyte Fontinalis antipyretica is fully aquatic presenting a streamer life form, while the three terrestrial species present turf life form with different sizes and degrees of space between individuals in the colony. Two species were collected under trees with moist soil presenting short turf (Tortella tortuosa) and long turf (Campylopus pyriformis) life forms. Another species was completely exposed to sun light with no surrounding trees and a tall turf life form (Pleurochaete squarrosa). We used chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm (maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II) as a proxy to photosynthetic fitness throughout the contrasting dehydration rates (fast and slow). These bryophytes with different life forms were submitted to an X-ray computed microtomography (µ-XCT) to assess the three-dimensional inner structure and visualize locations for water storage. Shoots dried slow or fast according to the dehydration they were exposed to, as expected, but they presented similar dehydration rates across different species. However, the aquatic moss F. antipyretica, was unable to recover from fast drying, and after 24 h the recovery following slow drying was lower than the other species. The other three species presented full recovery after 24 h, either at the individual or colony level, and either from slow or fast drying. The only exception was the colonies of Campylopus pyriformis following fast drying that presented a slightly lower recovery, probably due to a looser colony structure.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Desiccation Tolerance in Chlorophyllous Fern Spores: Are Ecophysiological Features Related to Environmental Conditions?',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Fern spores of most species are desiccation tolerant (DT) and, in some cases, are photosynthetic at maturation, the so-called chlorophyllous spores (CS). The lifespan of CS in the dry state is very variable among species. The physiological, biochemical, and biophysical mechanisms underpinning this variability remain understudied and their interpretation from an ecophysiological approach virtually unexplored. In this study, we aimed at fulfilling this gap by assessing photochemical, hydric, and biophysical properties of CS from three temperate species with contrasting biological strategies and longevity in the dry state: Equisetum telmateia (spore maturation and release in spring, ultrashort lifespan), Osmunda regalis (spore maturation and release in summer, medium lifespan), Matteuccia struthiopteris (spore maturation and release in winter, medium-long lifespan). After subjection of CS to controlled drying treatments, results showed that the three species displayed different extents of DT. CS of E. telmateia rapidly lost viability after desiccation, while the other two withstood several dehydration–rehydration cycles without compromising viability. The extent of DT was in concordance with water availability in the sporulation season of each species. CS of O. regalis and M. struthiopteris carried out the characteristic quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, widely displayed by other DT cryptogams during drying, and had higher tocopherol and proline contents. The turgor loss point of CS is also related to the extent of DT and to the sporulation season: lowest values were found in CS of M. struthiopteris and O. regalis. The hydrophobicity of spores in these two species was higher and probably related to the prevention of water absorption under unfavorable conditions. Molecular mobility, estimated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, confirmed an unstable glassy state in the spores of E. telmateia, directly related to the low DT, while the DT species entered in a stable glassy state when dried. Overall, our data revealed a DT syndrome related to the season of sporulation that was characterized by higher photoprotective potential, specific hydric properties, and lower molecular mobility in the dry state. Being unicellular haploid structures, CS represent not only a challenge for germplasm preservation (e.g., as these spores are prone to photooxidation) but also an excellent opportunity for studying mechanisms of DT in photosynthetic cells.'},\n",

The extraordinary botanical diversity of inselbergs in Madagascar. Candollea 74: 65–83. In English, English and French abstracts. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15553/c2019v741a8 Inselbergs are isolated mountains, mainly granitic or gneissic rock outcrops rising abruptly above surrounding plains. Malagasy inselbergs are often dome-shaped and occur in varying degrees of isolation, but they sometimes form inselberg landscapes, which comprise dozens of individual outcrops. Despite being typical landscape features on Madagascar's high plateau, little data are available on their detailed plant cover. Recent extensive fieldwork, which was conducted between 2010 and 2014, mainly on the central plateau, has resulted in a better knowledge about the floristic composition and habitats of Malagasy inselbergs. The most speciose vascular plant genera were Cynorkis Thouars (18), Cyperus L. (15) and Euphorbia L. (14). Malagasy inselbergs are centres of diversity for succulents (notably species of the genera Aloe L., Euphorbia and Kalanchoe Adans.), carnivorous plants (species of Drosera L. and Utricularia L.) and resurrection plants (notably species of Xerophyta Juss.). The most speciose habitat types were ephemeral flush vegetation and monocotyledonous mats. The latter habitat supports a large number of succulents and resurrection plants. In total 724 taxa out of 338 genera and 107 families have been recorded. Moreover, the variability in floristic composition between different regions is remarkable. Detrimental human impacts include quarrying, grazing, fire and the collection of plants for ornamental purposes (species of Pachypodium Lindl. and Orchidaceae) and as medicine (species of Aloe, Drosera madagascariensis DC., Myrothamnus moschatus (Baill.) Baill.). For the first time, recommendations are made for the conservation of Malagasy inselbergs.\"},\n",

       "   'title': 'Perspectives on Structural, Physiological, Cellular, and Molecular Responses to Desiccation in Resurrection Plants',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Resurrection plants possess a unique ability to counteract desiccation stress. Desiccation tolerance (DT) is a very complex multigenic and multifactorial process comprising a combination of physiological, morphological, cellular, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic processes. Modification in the sugar composition of the hemicellulosic fraction of the cell wall is detected during dehydration. An important change is a decrease of glucose in the hemicellulosic fraction during dehydration that can reflect a modification of the xyloglucan structure. The expansins might also be involved in cell wall flexibility during drying and disrupt hydrogen bonds between polymers during rehydration of the cell wall. Cleavages by xyloglucan-modifying enzymes release the tightly bound xyloglucan-cellulose network, thus increasing cell wall flexibility required for cell wall folding upon desiccation. Changes in hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) such as arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are also observed during desiccation and rehydration processes. It has also been observed that significant alterations in the process of photosynthesis and photosystem (PS) II activity along with changes in the antioxidant enzyme system also increased the cell wall and membrane fluidity resulting in DT. Similarly, recent data show a major role of ABA, LEA proteins, and small regulatory RNA in regulating DT responses. Current progress in “-omic” technologies has enabled quantitative monitoring of the plethora of biological molecules in a high throughput routine, making it possible to compare their levels between desiccation-sensitive and DT species. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of structural, physiological, cellular, molecular, and global responses involved in desiccation tolerance.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The desiccation-tolerant (DT) plants are poikilohydric and capable of surviving the loss of 90-95% of their cell water content. DT plants are important constituents of many ecosystems from the arctic (lichen and moss vegetations) to the tropics (lichen, moss and flower vegetations). Desiccation-tolerant (DT) plants may be subdivided into homoiochlorophyllous (HDT) and poikilochlorophyllous (PDT) types. The HDTs retain their chlorophyll on desiccation, whereas in PDTs desiccation results in the loss of chlorophyll, which must be resynthetized fol- lowing remoistening. The PDT strategy can be seen an the evolutionarily different new strategy. It is based on the dismantling of internal chloroplast structure by an ordered deconstruction process during drying, and its resynthesis upon rehydration. The selective advantage of poikilo- chlorophylly is in minimising photo-oxidative damage and not having to maintain an intact photosynthetic system through long (5-10 months) inactive periods of desiccation. Taxonomically the PDT plants appear to be restricted to the monocots.

       "   'abstract': 'The vegetative tissues of resurrection plants, like seeds, can tolerate desiccation to 5% relative water content (RWC) for extended periods and yet resume full metabolic activity on re-watering. In this review we will illustrate how this is achieved in a variety of angiosperm resurrection plants, our studies ranging from the ecophysiological to the biochemical level. At the whole plant level, leaf folding and other anatomical changes serve to minimise light and mechanical stress associated with drying and rehydration. The mechanisms of cell wall folding are described for Craterostigma wilmsii and Myrothanmus flabellifolia. Free radicals, radical oxygen species (ROS) usually generated under water-deficit stress by photosynthesis, are minimised by either homoiochlorophylly (e.g. C. wilmsii and M. flabellifolia) or poikilochlorophylly (e.g. Xerophyta sp.). The antioxidant systems of these plants effectively deal with ROS generated by other metabolic processes. In addition to antioxidants common to most plants, resurrection plants also accumulate polyphenols such as 3, 4, 5 tri-O-galloylquinic acid in M. flabellifolia, and seed-associated antioxidants (e.g. 1-cys-peroxiredoxin and metallothionines) as effective ROS scavengers. Sucrose accumulates at low RWC, presumably protecting the sub-cellular milieu against desiccation-induced macromolecular denaturation. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Within the monocotyledons the acquisition of the tree habit is enhanced by either primary growth of the axis or a distinctive mode of secondary growth. However, a few arborescent monocotyledons deviate from this pattern in developing trunks up to four meters high that resemble those of tree ferns, i.e., their \"woody-fibrous\" stems consist mainly of persistent leaf bases and adventitious roots. This type of arborescent monocotyledon occurs in both tropical and temperate regions and is found within Boryaceae (Borya), Cyperaceae (Afrotrilepis, Bulbostylis, Coleochloa, Microdracoides), and Velloziaceae (e.g., Vellozia, Xerophyta). They have developed in geographically widely separated regions with most of them occurring in the tropics and only Borya being a temperate zone outlier. These mostly miniature \"lily trees\" frequently occur in edaphically and climatologically extreme habitats (e.g., rock outcrops, white sand savannas). Characterized by a high degree of desiccation tolerance and a certain amount of fire-resistance, these plants are xerophytes that among vascular plants possess a unique combination of ecophysiological and morphoanatomical adaptations (e.g., poikilohydry, roots with velamen radicum). Moreover, most \"lily trees\" tend to form clonal populations of considerable age by means of stolons or by basal branching, which provides substantial advantages for the rapid and long lasting occupation of suitable sites. A summary is given of the major vegetative traits that obviously evolved independently within Boryaceae, Cyperaceae, and Velloziaceae.'},\n",

According to our results the cryptogams were able to recover their photosynthetic activity just after 4 months or less, while the leaves of X. scabrida and C. microcephala remained able to revive after 2-11 years of desiccation.
