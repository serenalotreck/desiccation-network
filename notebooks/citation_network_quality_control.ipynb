       " 'abstract': 'Desiccation of plants is often lethal but is tolerated by the majority of seeds and by vegetative tissues of only a small number of land plants. Desiccation tolerance is an ancient trait, lost from vegetative tissues following the appearance of tracheids but reappearing in several lineages when selection pressures favored its evolution. Cells of all desiccation-tolerant plants and seeds must possess a core set of mechanisms to protect them from desiccation- and rehydration-induced damage. This review explores how desiccation generates cell damage and how tolerant cells assuage the complex array of mechanical, structural, metabolic, and chemical stresses and survive. Likewise, the stress of rehydration requires appropriate mitigating cellular responses. We also explore what comparative genomics, both structural and responsive, have added to our understanding of cellular protection mechanisms induced by desiccation, and how vegetative desiccation tolerance circumvents destructive, stress-induced cell senescence.

       "   'abstract': 'Significance Desiccation tolerance likely evolved independently several times in grasses, providing an ideal comparative system to identify genetic elements controlling this trait. Using comparative genomics, we identified genomic and expression changes distinguishing the desiccation-tolerant grass Eragrostis nindensis from its desiccation-sensitive crop relative Eragrostis tef. We expanded these analyses to include several cereals to identify broadly conserved and divergent patterns during water stress. We found that the distinction between drought and desiccation in grasses is subtle, where genes with essential roles in seed development are broadly expressed under water stress. Thus we propose that seeds and leaves share common sets of coregulated genes of likely ancient origin, with only a few genes uniquely expressed for desiccation tolerance. Grasses are among the most resilient plants, and some can survive prolonged desiccation in semiarid regions with seasonal rainfall. However, the genetic elements that distinguish grasses that are sensitive versus tolerant to extreme drying are largely unknown. Here, we leveraged comparative genomic approaches with the desiccation-tolerant grass Eragrostis nindensis and the related desiccation-sensitive cereal Eragrostis tef to identify changes underlying desiccation tolerance. These analyses were extended across C4 grasses and cereals to identify broader evolutionary conservation and divergence. Across diverse genomic datasets, we identified changes in chromatin architecture, methylation, gene duplications, and expression dynamics related to desiccation in E. nindensis. It was previously hypothesized that transcriptional rewiring of seed desiccation pathways confers vegetative desiccation tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that the majority of seed-dehydration–related genes showed similar expression patterns in leaves of both desiccation-tolerant and -sensitive species. However, we identified a small set of seed-related orthologs with expression specific to desiccation-tolerant species. This supports a broad role for seed-related genes, where many are involved in typical drought responses, with only a small subset of crucial genes specifically induced in desiccation-tolerant plants.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Being sessile, plants must regulate energy balance, potentially via source-sink relations, to compromise growth with survival in stressful conditions. Crops are sensitive, possibly because they allocate their energy resources toward growth and yield rather than stress tolerance. In contrast, resurrection plants tightly regulate sugar metabolism and use a series of physiological adaptations to suppress cell death in their vegetative tissue to regain full metabolic capacity from a desiccated state within 72 h of watering. Previously, we showed that shoots of the resurrection plant Tripogon loliiformis, initiate autophagy upon dehydration as one strategy to reinstate homeostasis and suppress cell death. Here, we describe the relationship between energy status, sugar metabolism, trehalose-mediated activation of autophagy pathways and investigate whether shoots and roots utilize similar desiccation tolerance strategies. We show that despite containing high levels of trehalose, dehydrated Tripogon roots do not display elevated activation of autophagy pathways. Using targeted and non-targeted metabolomics, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and transcriptomics we show that T. loliiformis engages a strategy similar to the long-term drought responses of sensitive plants and continues to use the roots as a sink even during sustained stress. Dehydrating T. loliiformis roots contained more sucrose and trehalose-6-phosphate compared to shoots at an equivalent water content. The increased resources in the roots provides sufficient energy to cope with stress and thus autophagy is not required. These results were confirmed by the absence of autophagosomes in roots by TEM. Upregulation of sweet genes in both shoots and roots show transcriptional regulation of sucrose translocation from leaves to roots and within roots during dehydration. Differences in the cell’s metabolic status caused starkly different cell death responses between shoots and roots. These findings show how shoots and roots utilize different stress response strategies and may provide candidate targets that can be used as tools for the improvement of stress tolerance in crops.'},\n",

Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.'},\n",

To elucidate LEA proteins evolution and diversification, we performed a comprehensive synteny and phylogenetic analyses of the eight gene families across 60 complete plant genomes. Our integrated comparative genomic approach revealed that synteny conservation and diversification contributed to LEA family expansion and functional diversification in plants. We provide examples that: 1) the genomic diversification of the Dehydrin family contributed to differential evolution of amino acid sequences, protein biochemical properties, and gene expression patterns, and led to the appearance of a novel functional motif in angiosperms; 2) ancient genomic diversification contributed to the evolution of distinct intrinsically disordered regions of LEA_1 proteins; 3) recurrent tandem-duplications contributed to the large expansion of LEA_2; and 4) dynamic synteny diversification played a role on the evolution of LEA_4 and its function on plant desiccation tolerance. Taken together, these results show that multiple evolutionary mechanisms have not only led to genomic diversification but also to structural and functional plasticity among LEA proteins which have jointly contributed to the adaptation of plants to water-limiting environments.'},\n",

Although several resurrection plant genomes have been sequenced, the lack of suitable dehydration-sensitive outgroups has limited genomic insights into the origin of desiccation tolerance. Here, we utilized a comparative system of closely related desiccation-tolerant (Lindernia brevidens) and -sensitive (Lindernia subracemosa) species to identify gene- and pathway-level changes associated with the evolution of desiccation tolerance. The two high-quality Lindernia genomes we assembled are largely collinear, and over 90% of genes are conserved. L. brevidens and L. subracemosa have evidence of an ancient, shared whole-genome duplication event, and retained genes have neofunctionalized, with desiccation-specific expression in L. brevidens. Tandem gene duplicates also are enriched in desiccation-associated functions, including a dramatic expansion of early light-induced proteins from 4 to 26 copies in L. brevidens. A comparative differential gene coexpression analysis between L. brevidens and L. subracemosa supports extensive network rewiring across early dehydration, desiccation, and rehydration time courses. Many LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT genes show significantly higher expression in L. brevidens compared with their orthologs in L. subracemosa. Coexpression modules uniquely upregulated during desiccation in L. brevidens are enriched with seed-specific and abscisic acid-associated cis-regulatory elements. These modules contain a wide array of seed-associated genes that have no expression in the desiccation-sensitive L. subracemosa. Together, these findings suggest that desiccation tolerance evolved through a combination of gene duplications and network-level rewiring of existing seed desiccation pathways.'},\n",

Relatively few species (‘resurrection plants’) express this desiccation tolerance in their foliage. Knowledge of the regulation of desiccation tolerance in resurrection plant foliage is reviewed. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanism in resurrection grasses may lead to identification of genes that can improve stress tolerance and yield of major crop species. Well-hydrated leaves of resurrection plants are desiccation-sensitive and the leaves become desiccation tolerant as they are drying. Such drought-induction of desiccation tolerance involves changes in gene-expression causing extensive changes in the complement of proteins and the transition to a highly-stable quiescent state lasting months to years. These changes in gene-expression are regulated by several interacting phytohormones, of which drought-induced abscisic acid (ABA) is particularly important in some species. Treatment with only ABA induces desiccation tolerance in vegetative tissue of Borya constricta Churchill. and Craterostigma plantagineum Hochstetter. but not in the resurrection grass Sporobolus stapfianus Gandoger. Suppression of drought-induced senescence is also important for survival of drying.

These so‐called resurrection plants are desiccation tolerant because they can withstand drying to water contents below 0.1 gram water per gram dry weight and remain viable for extended periods of time, similar to most seeds. Indeed, recent research has shown that mechanisms of desiccation tolerance of different species, be it vegetative tissues or seeds, utilise the same basic ingredients, including anti‐oxidants, chaperone proteins, and specific carbohydrates. However, there is species‐specific behaviour, related to habitat, e.g. in cell wall properties and the manner in which photo‐oxidative damage is prevented upon drying. Crop plants produce desiccation‐tolerant seeds and, hence, possess the genomic information required for desiccation tolerance, but this is exclusively expressed in the seeds.

       "   'abstract': 'Resurrection plants possess a unique ability to counteract desiccation stress. Desiccation tolerance (DT) is a very complex multigenic and multifactorial process comprising a combination of physiological, morphological, cellular, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic processes. Modification in the sugar composition of the hemicellulosic fraction of the cell wall is detected during dehydration. An important change is a decrease of glucose in the hemicellulosic fraction during dehydration that can reflect a modification of the xyloglucan structure. The expansins might also be involved in cell wall flexibility during drying and disrupt hydrogen bonds between polymers during rehydration of the cell wall. Cleavages by xyloglucan-modifying enzymes release the tightly bound xyloglucan-cellulose network, thus increasing cell wall flexibility required for cell wall folding upon desiccation. Changes in hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) such as arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are also observed during desiccation and rehydration processes. It has also been observed that significant alterations in the process of photosynthesis and photosystem (PS) II activity along with changes in the antioxidant enzyme system also increased the cell wall and membrane fluidity resulting in DT. Similarly, recent data show a major role of ABA, LEA proteins, and small regulatory RNA in regulating DT responses. Current progress in “-omic” technologies has enabled quantitative monitoring of the plethora of biological molecules in a high throughput routine, making it possible to compare their levels between desiccation-sensitive and DT species.

Desiccation tolerance has multiple origins in flowering plants, and it likely evolved through rewiring seed desiccation pathways. Oropetium thomaeum is an emerging model for extreme drought tolerance, and its genome, which is the smallest among surveyed grasses, was recently sequenced. Combining RNA-seq, targeted metabolite analysis and comparative genomics, we show evidence for co-option of seed-specific pathways during vegetative desiccation. Desiccation-related gene co-expression clusters are enriched in functions related to seed development including several seed-specific transcription factors. Across the metabolic network, pathways involved in programmed cell death inhibition, ABA signalling and others are activated during dehydration. Oleosins and oil bodies that typically function in seed storage are highly abundant in desiccated leaves and may function for membrane stability and storage. Orthologs to seed-specific LEA proteins from rice and maize have neofunctionalized in Oropetium with high expression during desiccation. Accumulation of sucrose, raffinose and stachyose in drying leaves mirrors sugar accumulation patterns in maturing seeds.

While mechanistic studies focusing on the expression of this complex trait are numerous over the last 50 years, a firm conceptual framework for the ecology of desiccation tolerance in bryophytes has lagged behind. As a result of this, mechanistic studies have gone ahead without an ecological foundation, and this path can be scientifically risky. The motivating elements for this article include (1) the low visibility and lack of implementation of a conceptual framework for studying the ecology of DT in bryophytes, (2) the lack of a protocol for the step-by-step handling of field-collected or laboratory cultured specimens for study of desiccation tolerance with particular attention to the deacclimation of plants, (3) a recognition that most studies of desiccation tolerance tend to conflate two of the most important factors of desiccation, rate of desiccation and water content, and (4) recognizing that the ecological factors of rehydration, aside from recovery, are nearly always ignored in experiments on desiccation tolerance in bryophytes. Therefore this review postulates a conceptual framework for the ecology of desiccation tolerance, presenting the principal factors of desiccation (rate of drying, water content at equilibration, duration dry, and rate of rehydration) and how they may interact, presenting the principal physiological phases of rehydration (recovery, hardening, dehardening), and highlighting the importance of specimen handling in preparation for an experiment on DT. Useful metrics for assessment are derived that include the minimum rate of drying tolerated at a given water content, the minimum or maximum water content tolerated, the maximum duration dry tolerated, and the minimum dehardening time exhibited.'},\n",

Using transcriptomes of developing Mt-abi5 seeds, we created a gene coexpression network and revealed ABI5 as a regulator of gene modules with functions related to raffinose family oligosaccharide (RFO) metabolism, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, and photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs). Lower RFO contents in Mt-abi5 seeds were linked to the regulation of SEED IMBIBITION PROTEIN1. Proteomic analysis confirmed that a set of LEA polypeptides was reduced in mature Mt-abi5 seeds, whereas the absence of repression of PhANG in mature Mt-abi5 seeds was accompanied by chlorophyll and carotenoid retention. This resulted in a stress response in Mt-abi5 seeds, evident from an increase in α-tocopherol and upregulation of genes related to programmed cell death and protein folding. Characterization of abi5 mutants in a second legume species, pea (Pisum sativum), confirmed a role for ABI5 in the regulation of longevity, seed degreening, and RFO accumulation, identifying ABI5 as a prominent regulator of late seed maturation in legumes.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Besides the deposition of storage reserves, seed maturation is characterized by the acquisition of functional traits including germination, desiccation tolerance, dormancy, and longevity. After seed filling, seed longevity increases up to 30-fold, concomitant with desiccation that brings the embryo to a quiescent state. The period that we define as late maturation phase can represent 10-78% of total seed development time, yet it remains overlooked. Its importance is underscored by the fact that in the seed production chain, the stage of maturity at harvest is the primary factor that influences seed longevity and seedling establishment. This review describes the major events and regulatory pathways underlying the acquisition of seed longevity, focusing on key indicators of maturity such as chlorophyll degradation, accumulation of raffinose family oligosaccharides, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, and heat shock proteins. We discuss how these markers are correlated with or contribute to seed longevity, and highlight questions that merit further attention. We present evidence suggesting that molecular players involved in biotic defence also have a regulatory role in seed longevity. We also explore how the concept of plasticity can help understand the acquisition of longevity.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The group of homoiochlorophyllous resurrection plants evolved the unique capability to survive severe drought stress without dismantling the photosynthetic machinery. This implies that they developed efficient strategies to protect the leaves from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photosynthetic side reactions. These strategies, however, are poorly understood. Here, we performed a detailed study of the photosynthetic machinery in the homoiochlorophyllous resurrection plant Craterostigma pumilum during dehydration and upon recovery from desiccation. During dehydration and rehydration, C.\\xa0pumilum deactivates and activates partial components of the photosynthetic machinery in a specific order, allowing for coordinated shutdown and subsequent reinstatement of photosynthesis. Early responses to dehydration are the closure of stomata and activation of electron transfer to oxygen accompanied by inactivation of the cytochrome b6 f complex leading to attenuation of the photosynthetic linear electron flux (LEF). The decline in LEF is paralleled by a gradual increase in cyclic electron transport to maintain ATP production. At low water contents, inactivation and supramolecular reorganization of photosystem II becomes apparent, accompanied by functional detachment of light-harvesting complexes and interrupted access to plastoquinone. This well-ordered sequence of alterations in the photosynthetic thylakoid membranes helps prepare the plant for the desiccated state and minimize ROS production.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Classically, lichen phycobionts are described as poikilohydric organisms able to undergo desiccation due to the constitutive presence of molecular protection mechanisms. However, little is known about the induction of cellular responses in lichen phycobionts during drying. The analysis of the lipid composition of the desiccated lichen microalga Asterochloris erici revealed the unusual accumulation of highly polar lipids (oligogalactolipids and phosphatidylinositol), which prevents the fusion of membranes during stress, but also the active degradation of cone-shaped lipids (monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine) to stabilize membranes in desiccated cells. The level of phosphatidic acid increased 7-fold during desiccation, implicating a possible role for phospholipase D (PLD) in the response to osmotic stress. Inhibition of PLD with 1-butanol markedly impaired the recovery of photosynthesis activity in A. erici upon desiccation and salt stress (2 M NaCl). These two hyperosmotic stresses caused the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-like mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The incubation with 1-butanol reduced the phosphorylation of JNK-like proteins and increased the dephosphorylation of ERK-like proteins, which indicates an upstream control of MAPK cascades by PLD. The phosphoproteome showed that desiccation caused the phosphorylation of several proteins in A. erici, most of them involved in protein turnover. The results demonstrate that lichen phycobionts possess both constitutive and inducible protective mechanisms to acquire desiccation tolerance. Among others, these responses are controlled by the PLD pathway through the activation of MAPK cascades.'},\n",

Zygnematophyceae (Conjugating green algae) are considered to be closest algal relatives to land plants (Embryophyta). Therefore, they are ideal model organisms for studying stress tolerance mechanisms connected with transition to land, one of the most important events in plant evolution and the Earth’s history. In Zygnematophyceae, but also in Coleochaetophyceae, Chlorokybophyceae, and Klebsormidiophyceae terrestrial members are found which are frequently exposed to naturally occurring abiotic stress scenarios like desiccation, freezing and high photosynthetic active (PAR) as well as ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Here, we summarize current knowledge about various stress tolerance mechanisms including insight provided by pioneer transcriptomic and proteomic studies. While formation of dormant spores is a typical strategy of freshwater classes, true terrestrial groups are stress tolerant in vegetative state. Aggregation of cells, flexible cell walls, mucilage production and accumulation of osmotically active compounds are the most common desiccation tolerance strategies. In addition, high photophysiological plasticity and accumulation of UV-screening compounds are important protective mechanisms in conditions with high irradiation. Now a shift from classical chemical analysis to next-generation genome sequencing, gene reconstruction and annotation, genome-scale molecular analysis using omics technologies followed by computer-assisted analysis will give new insights in a systems biology approach. For example, changes in transcriptome and role of phytohormone signaling in Klebsormidium during desiccation were recently described. Application of these modern approaches will deeply enhance our understanding of stress reactions in an unbiased non-targeted view in an evolutionary context.'},\n",

While ABA has been found in unicellular photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, its function in these organisms is poorly understood. Here, we found that ABA accumulated in the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae under conditions of salt stress and that the cell cycle G1/S transition was inhibited when ABA was added to the culture medium. A gene encoding heme-scavenging tryptophan-rich sensory protein-related protein (CmTSPO; CMS231C) was positively regulated by ABA, as in Arabidopsis, and CmTSPO bound heme in vitro. The intracellular content of total heme was increased by addition of ABA, but unfettered heme decreased, presumably due to scavenging by CmTSPO. The inhibition of DNA replication by ABA was negated by addition of heme to the culture medium. Thus, we propose a regulatory role for ABA and heme in algal cell cycle initiation. Finally, we found that a C. merolae mutant that is defective in ABA production was more susceptible to salt stress, indicating the importance of ABA to stress resistance in red algae.'},\n",

The transition from a quiescent dry seed to an actively growing photoautotrophic seedling is a complex and crucial trait for plant propagation. This study provides a detailed description of global gene expression in seven successive developmental stages of seedling establishment in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Using the transcriptome signature from these developmental stages, we obtained a coexpression gene network that highlights interactions between known regulators of the seed-to-seedling transition and predicts the functions of uncharacterized genes in seedling establishment. The coexpressed gene data sets together with the transcriptional module indicate biological functions related to seedling establishment. Characterization of the homeodomain leucine zipper I transcription factor AtHB13, which is expressed during the seed-to-seedling transition, demonstrated that this gene regulates some of the network nodes and affects late seedling establishment. Knockout mutants for athb13 showed increased primary root length as compared with wild-type (Columbia-0) seedlings, suggesting that this transcription factor is a negative regulator of early root growth, possibly repressing cell division and/or cell elongation or the length of time that cells elongate. The signal transduction pathways present during the early phases of the seed-to-seedling transition anticipate the control of important events for a vigorous seedling, such as root growth.

Desiccation‐tolerant resurrection plants can survive conditions of very low relative water content. During desiccation, photosynthesis is not operational, but is recovered within a short period after rehydration. While homoiochlorophyllous resurrection plants retain their photosynthetic apparatus during desiccation, poikilochlorophyllous resurrection species dismantle chloroplasts and degrade chlorophyll but resynthesize them again during rehydration. Dismantling the chloroplasts avoids the photooxidative stress in poikilochlorophyllous resurrection plants, whereas it is minimized in homoiochlorophyllous plants through the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes and protective proteins or metabolites. Although the cellular protection mechanisms in both of these species vary, these mechanisms protect cells from desiccation‐induced damage and restore photosynthesis upon rehydration. Several of the proteins synthesized during dehydration are localized in chloroplasts and are believed to play major roles in the protection of photosynthetic structures and in recovery in resurrection species. This review focuses on the strategies of resurrection plants in terms of how they protect their photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative stress during desiccation without membrane damage and with full recovery during rehydration.

There is an urgent need for the development of robust measures that enable crops to withstand the uncertainty of climate change whilst still producing maximum yields. Resurrection plants possess the unique ability to withstand desiccation for prolonged periods, can be restored upon watering and represent great potential for the development of stress tolerant crops. Here, we describe the remarkable stress characteristics of Tripogon loliiformis, an uncharacterised resurrection grass and close relative of the economically important cereals, rice, sorghum, and maize. We show that T. loliiformis survives extreme environmental stress by implementing autophagy to prevent Programmed Cell Death. Notably, we identified a novel role for trehalose in the regulation of autophagy in T.loliiformis. Transcriptome, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, immunoblotting and confocal microscopy analyses directly linked the accumulation of trehalose with the onset of autophagy in dehydrating and desiccated T. loliiformis shoots. These results were supported in vitro with the observation of autophagosomes in trehalose treated T. loliiformis leaves; autophagosomes were not detected in untreated samples. Presumably, once induced, autophagy promotes desiccation tolerance in T.loliiformis, by removal of cellular toxins to suppress programmed cell death and the recycling of nutrients to delay the onset of senescence. These findings illustrate how resurrection plants manipulate sugar metabolism to promote desiccation tolerance and may provide candidate genes that are potentially useful for the development of stress tolerant crops.'},\n",

The molecular basis of this observation was investigated by comparing gene expression profiles under different degrees of water deprivation. Transcripts were clustered according to the expression profiles in plants that were air-dried (rapid desiccation), soil-dried (gradual desiccation), rehydrated (acclimated) and air-dried after acclimation. Although phenotypically indistinguishable, it was shown by principal component analysis that the gene expression profiles in rehydrated, acclimated plants resemble those of desiccated plants more closely than those of hydrated acclimated plants. Enrichment analysis based on gene ontology was performed to deconvolute the processes that accompanied desiccation tolerance. Transcripts associated with autophagy and α-tocopherol accumulation were found to be activated in both air-dried, acclimated plants and soil-dried non-acclimated plants. Furthermore, transcripts associated with biosynthesis of ascorbic acid, cell wall catabolism, chaperone-assisted protein folding, respiration and macromolecule catabolism were activated and maintained during soil-drying and rehydration. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that activation of these processes leads to the establishment of an optimal physiological and cellular state that enables tolerance during rapid air-drying.

To our knowledge, this is the first genome sequence of a desiccation-tolerant extremophile, offering insight into the evolution of this important trait and a first look, to our knowledge, into the genome organization of desiccation tolerance. The underpinning genome architecture and response in relation to the hydration state of the plant and its role in the preservation of cellular integrity has important implications for developing drought tolerance improvement strategies for our crops. “Drying without dying” is an essential trait in land plant evolution. Unraveling how a unique group of angiosperms, the Resurrection Plants, survive desiccation of their leaves and roots has been hampered by the lack of a foundational genome perspective. Here we report the ∼1,691-Mb sequenced genome of Boea hygrometrica, an important resurrection plant model. The sequence revealed evidence for two historical genome-wide duplication events, a compliment of 49,374 protein-coding genes, 29.15% of which are unique (orphan) to Boea and 20% of which (9,888) significantly respond to desiccation at the transcript level. Expansion of early light-inducible protein (ELIP) and 5S rRNA genes highlights the importance of the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus during drying and the rapid resumption of protein synthesis in the resurrection capability of Boea. Transcriptome analysis reveals extensive alternative splicing of transcripts and a focus on cellular protection strategies. The lack of desiccation tolerance-specific genome organizational features suggests the resurrection phenotype evolved mainly by an alteration in the control of dehydration response genes.'},\n",

It has been recently shown that one of the strategies developed by resurrection plants to overcome dehydration is based on cell wall composition. For this purpose, the structural characterization of arabinoxylans from desiccation-tolerant grass Eragrostis nindensis (E. nindensis) was compared with its close relative, the desiccation-sensitive Eragrostis tef (E. tef) in order to further understand mechansism of desiccation tolerance in resurrection plants.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nIon mobility spectrometry coupled to mass spectrometry (IM-MS) in combination with the conventional mass spectrometric approaches, including matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), electrospray ionization multistage tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS(n)) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), were used to characterize arabinoxylan fragments obtained after endo-xylanase digestion of leave extracts from E. nindensis and E. tef.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nWhole fingerprinting by MALDI-MS analysis showed the presence of various arabinoxylan fragments within leaves of E. nindensis and E. tef.

It tolerates great temperature variations, which are associated to periods of up to 30 days without precipitation. Using a metabolomic approach, we analyzed, under winter and summer conditions, changes in the leaf metabolite profile (MP) of potted plants of B. purpurea submitted to daily watered and water deficit for at least 20 days and subsequent slow rehydration for 5 days. Leaves were collected at different time points and had their MP analyzed by GC/MS, HPAEC, and UHPLC techniques, allowing the identification of more than 60 different compounds, including organic and amino acids, sugars, and polyols, among others. In the winter experiment, results suggest the presence of two time-dependent responses in B. purpurea under water stress. The first one starts with the increase in the content of caffeoyl-quinic acids, substances with strong antioxidant activity, until the 16th day of water suppression. When RWC reached less than 80 and 70%, in winter and summer respectively, it was observed an increase in polyols and monosaccharides, followed by an increment in the content of RFO, suggesting osmotic adjustment. Amino acids, such as GABA and asparagine, also increased due to 16 days of water suppression. During rehydration, the levels of the mentioned compounds became similar to those found at the beginning of the experiment and when compared to daily watered plants. We conclude that the tolerance of B. purpurea to dehydration involves the perception of water deficit intensity, which seems to result in different strategies to overcome the gradient of water availability imposed along a certain period of stress mainly during winter. Data from summer experiment indicate that the metabolism of B. pupurea was already primed for drought stress. The accumulation of phenolics in summer seemed to be more temperature and irradiance-dependent than on the RWC.'},\n",

Analysis of molecular species composition revealed that around 50% of 36:x (number of carbons in the acyl chains: number of double bonds) MGDG was hydrolysed and diacylglycerol (DAG) used for phospholipid synthesis, while another MGDG fraction was converted into digalactosyldiacylglycerol via the DGD1/DGD2 pathway and subsequently into oligogalactolipids by SFR2. 36:x-DAG was also employed for the synthesis of triacylglycerol. Phosphatidic acid (PA) increased in C.\\xa0plantagineum, L.\\xa0brevidens, and L.\\xa0subracemosa, in agreement with a role of PA as an intermediate of lipid turnover and of phospholipase D in signalling during desiccation. 34:x-DAG, presumably derived from de novo assembly, was converted into phosphatidylinositol (PI) in C.\\xa0plantagineum and L.\\xa0brevidens, but not in desiccation-sensitive plants, suggesting that PI is involved in acquisition of desiccation tolerance. The accumulation of oligogalactolipids and PI in the chloroplast and extraplastidial membranes, respectively, increases the concentration of hydroxyl groups and enhances the ratio of bilayer- to non-bilayer-forming lipids, thus contributing to protein and membrane stabilization.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Although most green algae typically occur in aquatic ecosystems, many species also live partly or permanently under aeroterrestrial conditions, where the cells are exposed to the atmosphere and hence regularly experience dehydration. The ability of algal cells to survive in an air-dried state is termed desiccation tolerance. The mechanisms involved in desiccation tolerance of green algae are still poorly understood, and hence the aim of this review is to summarize recent findings on the effects of desiccation and osmotic water loss. Starting from structural changes, physiological, and biochemical consequences of desiccation will be addressed in different green-algal lineages. The available data clearly indicate a range of strategies, which are rather different in streptophycean and non-streptophycean green algae. While members of the Trebouxiophyceae exhibit effective water loss-prevention mechanisms based on the biosynthesis and accumulation of particular organic osmolytes such as polyols, these compounds are so far not reported in representatives of the Streptophyta. In members of the Streptophyta such as Klebsormidium, the most striking observation is the appearance of cross-walls in desiccated samples, which are strongly undulating, suggesting a high degree of mechanical flexibility. This aids in maintaining structural integrity in the dried state and allows the cell to maintain turgor pressure for a prolonged period of time during the dehydration process. Physiological strategies in aeroterrestrial green algae generally include a rapid reduction of photosynthesis during desiccation, but also a rather quick recovery after rewetting, whereas aquatic species are sensitive to drying. The underlying mechanisms such as the affected molecular components of the photosynthetic machinery are poorly understood in green algae. Therefore, modern approaches based on transcriptomics, proteomics, and/or metabolomics are urgently needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in desiccation-stress physiology of these organisms. The very limited existing information is described in the present review.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The filamentous green alga Zygogonium ericetorum (Zygnematophyceae, Streptophyta) was collected in a high‐alpine rivulet in Tyrol, Austria. Two different morphotypes of this alga were found: a purple morph with a visible purple vacuolar content and a green morph lacking this coloration. These morphotypes were compared with respect to their secondary metabolites, ultrastructure, and ecophysiological properties. Colorimetric tests with aqueous extracts of the purple morph indicated the presence of soluble compounds such as phenolics and hydrolyzable tannins. High‐performance liquid chromatography‐screening showed that Z. ericetorum contained several large phenolic peaks with absorption maxima at ~280 nm and sometimes with minor maxima at ~380 nm. Such compounds are uncommon for freshwater green microalgae, and could contribute to protect the organism against increased UV and visible (VIS) irradiation. The purple Z. ericetorum contained larger amounts (per dry weight) of the putative phenolic substances than the green morph; exposure to irradiation may be a key factor for accumulation of these phenolic compounds. Transmission electron microscopy of the purple morph showed massive vacuolization with homogenous medium electron‐dense content in the cell periphery, which possibly contains the secondary compounds. In contrast, the green morph had smaller, electron‐translucent vacuoles. The ecophysiological data on photosynthesis and desiccation tolerance indicated that increasing photon fluence densities led to much higher relative electron transport rates (rETR) in the purple than in the green morph. These data suggest that the secondary metabolites in the purple morph are important for light acclimation in high‐alpine habitats. However, the green morph recovered better after 4 d of rehydration following desiccation stress.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In a minute proportion of angiosperm species, rehydrating foliage can revive from airdryness or even from equilibration with air of ~0% RH. Such desiccation tolerance is known from vegetative cells of some species of algae and of major groups close to the evolutionary path of the angiosperms. It is also found in the reproductive structures of some algae, moss spores and probably the aerial spores of other terrestrial cryptogamic taxa. The occurrence of desiccation tolerance in the seed plants is overwhelmingly in the aerial reproductive structures; the pollen and seed embryos. Spatially and temporally, pollen and embryos are close ontogenetic derivatives of the angiosperm microspores and megaspores respectively. This suggests that the desiccation tolerance of pollen and embryos derives from the desiccation tolerance of the spores of antecedent taxa and that the basic pollen/embryo mechanism of desiccation tolerance has eventually become expressed also in the vegetative tissue of certain angiosperm species whose drought avoidance is inadequate in micro-habitats that suffer extremely xeric episodes. The protective compounds and processes that contribute to desiccation tolerance in angiosperms are found in the modern groups related to the evolutionary path leading to the angiosperms and are also present in the algae and in the cyanobacteria. The mechanism of desiccation tolerance in the angiosperms thus appears to have its origins in algal ancestors and possibly in the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria-related progenitor of chloroplasts and the bacteria-related progenitor of mitochondria. The mechanism may involve the regulation and timing of the accumulation of protective compounds and of other contributing substances and processes.'},\n",

In order to understand the metabolic basis of DT, S. lepidophylla was subjected to a five-stage, rehydration/dehydration cycle, then analyzed using non-biased, global metabolomics profiling technology based on GC/MS and UHLC/MS/MS(2) platforms. A total of 251 metabolites including 167 named (66.5%) and 84 (33.4%) unnamed compounds were characterized. Only 42 (16.7%) and 74 (29.5%) of compounds showed significantly increased or decreased abundance, respectively, indicating that most compounds were produced constitutively, including highly abundant trehalose, sucrose, and glucose. Several glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates showed increased abundance at 100% relative water content (RWC) and 50% RWC. Vanillate, a potent antioxidant, was also more abundant in the hydrated state. Many different sugar alcohols and sugar acids were more abundant in the hydrated state. These polyols likely decelerate the rate of water loss during the drying process as well as slow water absorption during rehydration, stabilize proteins, and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, nitrogen-rich and γ-glutamyl amino acids, citrulline, and nucleotide catabolism products (e.g. allantoin) were more abundant in the dry states, suggesting that these compounds might play important roles in nitrogen remobilization during rehydration or in ROS scavenging. UV-protective compounds such as 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, apigenin, and naringenin, were more abundant in the dry states. Most lipids were produced constitutively, with the exception of choline phosphate, which was more abundant in dry states and likely plays a role in membrane hydration and stabilization. In contrast, several polyunsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the hydrated states, suggesting that these compounds likely help maintain membrane fluidity during dehydration. Lastly, S. lepidophylla contained seven unnamed compounds that displayed twofold or greater abundance in dry or rehydrating states, suggesting that these compounds might play adaptive roles in DT.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'We investigated the photosynthetic limitations occurring during dehydration and rehydration of Xerophyta humilis, a poikilochlorophyllous resurrection plant, and whether volatile and non-volatile isoprenoids might be involved in desiccation tolerance. Photosynthesis declined rapidly after dehydration below 85% relative water content (RWC). Raising intercellular CO(2) concentrations during desiccation suggest that the main photosynthetic limitation was photochemical, affecting energy-dependent RuBP regeneration. Imaging fluorescence confirmed that both the number of photosystem II (PSII) functional reaction centres and their efficiency were impaired under progressive dehydration, and revealed the occurrence of heterogeneous photosynthesis during desiccation, being the basal leaf area more resistant to the stress. Full recovery in photosynthetic parameters occurred on rehydration, confirming that photosynthetic limitations were fully reversible and that no permanent damage occurred. During desiccation, zeaxanthin and lutein increased only when photosynthesis had ceased, implying that these isoprenoids do not directly scavenge reactive oxygen species, but rather protect photosynthetic membranes from damage and consequent denaturation. X.\\u2003humilis was found to emit isoprene, a volatile isoprenoid that acts as a membrane strengthener in plants. Isoprene emission was stimulated by drought and peaked at 80% RWC. We surmise that isoprene and non-volatile isoprenoids cooperate in reducing membrane damage in X.\\u2003humilis, isoprene being effective when desiccation is moderate while non-volatile isoprenoids operate when water deficit is more extreme.'},\n",

ABI3 target promoters are enriched for G-box-like and RY-like elements. The general occurrence of these cis motifs in non-ABI3 target promoters suggests the existence of as yet unidentified regulatory signals, some of which may be associated with epigenetic control. Several members of the ABI3 regulon are also regulated by other transcription factors, including the seed-specific, B3 domain-containing FUS3 and LEC2.

The extracellular coverings of green algae including cell walls are also diverse. A recent surge of research in green algal cell walls fueled by new emerging technologies has revealed new and critical insight concerning these coverings. For example, the late divergent taxa of the Charophycean green algae possess cell walls containing assemblages of polymers with notable similarity to the cellulose, pectins, hemicelluloses, arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensin, and lignin present in embryophyte walls. Ulvophycean seaweeds have cell wall components whose most abundant fibrillar constituents may change from cellulose to β-mannans to β-xylans and during different life cycle phases. Likewise, these algae produce complex sulfated polysaccharides, AGPs, and extensin. Chlorophycean green algae produce a wide array of walls ranging from cellulose–pectin complexes to ones made of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. Larger and more detailed surveys of the green algal taxa including incorporation of emerging genomic and transcriptomic data are required in order to more fully resolve evolutionary trends within the green algae and in relationship with higher plants as well as potential applications of wall components in the food and pharmaceutical industries.'},\n",

Plants must regulate their use of absorbed light energy on a minute-by-minute basis to maximize the efficiency of photosynthesis and to protect photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers from photooxidative damage. The regulation of light harvesting involves the photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the light-harvesting antenna complexes (LHCs) as heat. Here, we report an investigation into the structural basis of light-harvesting regulation in intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts using freeze-fracture electron microscopy, combined with laser confocal microscopy employing the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. The results demonstrate that formation of the photoprotective state requires a structural reorganization of the photosynthetic membrane involving dissociation of LHCII from PSII and its aggregation. The structural changes are manifested by a reduced mobility of LHC antenna chlorophyll proteins. It is demonstrated that these changes occur rapidly and reversibly within 5 min of illumination and dark relaxation, are dependent on ΔpH, and are enhanced by the deepoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin.'},\n",

S. stapfianus had higher concentrations of osmolytes, lower concentrations of metabolites associated with energy metabolism, and higher concentrations of nitrogen metabolites, suggesting that it is primed metabolically for dehydration stress. Further reduction of the leaf RWC to 60% instigated a metabolic shift in S. stapfianus toward the production of protective compounds, whereas S. pyramidalis responded differently. The metabolomes of S. stapfianus leaves below 40% RWC were strongly directed toward antioxidant production, nitrogen remobilization, ammonia detoxification, and soluble sugar production.

       "   'abstract': 'Anhydrobiotic (i.e., life without water) organisms are known to produce group 3 late embryogenesis abundant (G3LEA) proteins during adaptation to severely water-deficient conditions. Their primary amino acid sequences are composed largely of loosely conserved 11-mer repeat units. However, little information has been obtained for the structural and functional roles of these repeat units. In this study, we first explore the consensus sequences of the 11-mer repeat units for several native G3LEA proteins originating from anhydrobiotic organisms among insects (Polypedilum vanderplanki), nematodes, and plants. Next, we synthesize four kinds of model peptides (LEA models), each of which consists of four or two repeats of the 11-mer consensus sequences for each of the three organisms. The structural and thermodynamic properties of the LEA models were examined in solution, in dehydrated and rehydrated states, and furthermore in the presence of trehalose, since a great quantity of this sugar is known to be produced in the dried cells of most anhydrobiotic organisms. The results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic measurements indicate that all of the LEA models transform from random coils to alpha-helical coiled coils on dehydration and return to random coils again on rehydration, both with and without trehalose. In contrast, such structural changes were never observed for a control peptide with a randomized amino acid sequence. Furthermore, our differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements provide the first evidence that the above 11-mer motif-containing peptides themselves vitrify with a high glass transition temperature (>100 degrees C) and a low enthalpy relaxation rate. In addition, they play a role in reinforcing the glassy matrix of the coexisting trehalose. On the basis of these results, we discuss the underlying mechanism of G3LEA proteins as desiccation stress protectants.'},\n",

Under low light during growth and WD, A is stimulated by elevated CO(2), showing that metabolism (A(pot)) is not impaired, but at high light A is not stimulated, showing inhibition. At a given intercellular CO(2) concentration (C(i)) A decreases, showing impaired metabolism (A(pot)). The C(i) and probably chloroplast CO(2) concentration (C(c)), decreases and then increases, together with the equilibrium CO(2) concentration, with greater WD. Estimation of C(c) and internal (mesophyll) conductance (g(i)) is considered uncertain. Photosystem activity is unaffected until very severe WD, maintaining electron (e(-)) transport (ET) and reductant content. Low A, together with photorespiration (PR), which is maintained or decreased, provides a smaller sink for e(-)(,) causing over-energization of energy transduction. Despite increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), excess energy and e(-) result in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence is considered that ROS damages ATP synthase so that ATP content decreases progressively with WD. Decreased ATP limits RuBP production by the Calvin cycle and thus A(pot). Rubisco activity is unlikely to determine A(pot). Sucrose synthesis is limited by lack of substrate and impaired enzyme regulation. With WD, PR decreases relative to light respiration (R(L)), and mitochondria consume reductant and synthesise ATP. With progressing WD at low A, R(L) increases C(i) and C(c). This review emphasises the effects of light intensity, considers techniques, and develops a qualitative model of photosynthetic metabolism under WD that explains many observations: testable hypotheses are suggested.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract Desiccation-tolerance, the ability to revive from the air-dried state, is found in prokaryotes, algae and bryophytes, and occasionally in pteridophytes, but is very rare in the vegetative tissues of angiosperms or in animal tissues. However, the vast majority of lichens are desiccation-tolerant. Under natural conditions, the life of most lichens is characterized by rapidly changing water contents, and correspondingly rapidly changing physiological activity such as respiration and photosynthesis. Taken to the extreme, some lichens can revive after being desiccated under controlled laboratory conditions for many months. As a result of their desiccation-tolerance, lichens are extremophiles and can live in places no higher plant can. They may be the predominant life-form in ecosystems characterized by severe environmental stresses such as Arctic, Antarctic and alpine regions, as well as deserts. This review critically assesses our current knowledge about desiccation-tolerance in lichens, concentrating on mechanisms that protect from desiccation-induced damage. Evidence available from other desiccation-tolerant life-forms suggests that desiccation-tolerance is a multifaceted trait involving a suite of interacting mechanisms. The majority of recent studies on mechanisms of lichen desiccation-tolerance have focused on the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, which therefore forms a major part of this review. It is argued that effective control of reactive oxygen species and mutual up-regulation of protective mechanisms was critically important for the evolution of lichens, facilitating the transition from free-living fungi and green algae or cyanobacteria to the lichenized state. Recently developed tools of molecular biology, particularly from the -omics disciplines, have only just started to be applied to lichens. There remain many unsolved questions as to how lichens survive desiccation and the authors hope to encourage more scientists to investigate this intriguing phenomenon.'},\n",

Here, we present the xeroplast to chloroplast transition during rehydration of the resurrection plant Xerophyta humilis as a novel system for studying chloroplast biogenesis, and investigate the role of light in this process. Xeroplasts are characterized by the presence of numerous large and small membrane-bound vesicles and the complete absence of thylakoid membranes. While the initial assembly of stromal thylakoid membranes occurs independently of light, the formation of grana is light dependent. Recovery of photosynthetic activity is rapid in plants rehydrated in the light and correlates with the light-dependent synthesis of the D1 protein, but does not require de novo chlorophyll biosynthesis. Light-dependent synthesis of the chlorophyll-binding protein Lhcb2 and digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase 1 correlated with the formation of grana and with the increased PSII activity. Our results suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying photomorphogenic development may also function in desiccation tolerance in poikilochlorophyllous resurrection plants.'},\n",

Leaves of this mutant are devoid of photosystem II (PSII) Chl-protein antenna complexes and have a very low capacity of nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of Chl fluorescence. Lhcb5 was the only PSII antenna protein that accumulated to a significant level in ch1 mutant leaves, but the apoprotein did not assemble in vivo with Chls to form a functional antenna. The abundance of Lhca proteins was also reduced to approximately 20% of the wild-type level. ch1 was crossed with various xanthophyll mutants to analyze the antioxidant activity of carotenoids unbound to PSII antenna. Suppression of zeaxanthin by crossing ch1 with npq1 resulted in oxidative stress in high light, while removing other xanthophylls or the PSII protein PsbS had no such effect. The tocopherol-deficient ch1 vte1 double mutant was as sensitive to high light as ch1 npq1, and the triple mutant ch1 npq1 vte1 exhibited an extreme sensitivity to photooxidative stress, indicating that zeaxanthin and tocopherols have cumulative effects. Conversely, constitutive accumulation of zeaxanthin in the ch1 npq2 double mutant led to an increased phototolerance relative to ch1. Comparison of ch1 npq2 with another zeaxanthin-accumulating mutant (ch1 lut2) that lacks lutein suggests that protection of polyunsaturated lipids by zeaxanthin is enhanced when lutein is also present. During photooxidative stress, α-tocopherol noticeably decreased in ch1 npq1 and increased in ch1 npq2 relative to ch1, suggesting protection of vitamin E by high zeaxanthin levels. Our results indicate that the antioxidant activity of zeaxanthin, distinct from NPQ, can occur in the absence of PSII light-harvesting complexes. The capacity of zeaxanthin to protect thylakoid membrane lipids is comparable to that of vitamin E but noticeably higher than that of all other xanthophylls of Arabidopsis leaves.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract Desiccation-tolerance (DT), the ability to lose virtually all free intracellular water and then recover normal function upon rehydration, is one of the most remarkable features of bryophytes. The physiology of bryophytes differs in major respects from that of vascular plants by virtue of their smaller size; unlike vascular plants, the leafy shoots of bryophytes equilibrate rapidly with the water potential in their surroundings and tend to be either fully hydrated or desiccated and metabolically inactive. The time required to recover from desiccation increases and degree of recovery decreases with length of desiccation; both also depend upon temperature and intensity of desiccation. Tolerance in at least some species shows phenotypic plasticity. Recovery of respiration, photosynthesis and protein synthesis takes place within minutes or an hour or two; recovery of the cell cycle, food transport and the cytoskeleton may take 24 hours or more. Positive carbon balance is essential to survival of repeated cycles of drying and wetting; significant growth requires continuously wet periods of a few days or more. Male and female gametophytes, and gametophyte and sporophyte, may differ in tolerance. Desiccation-tolerance is essential to dispersal and establishment of spores and vegetative propagules. The mechanisms of DT in bryophytes, including expression of LEA proteins, high content of non-reducing sugars and effective antioxidant and photo-protection, are at least partly constitutive, allowing survival of rapid drying, but changes in gene expression resulting from mRNA sequestration and alterations in translational controls elicited upon rehydration are also important to repair processes following re-wetting. Phylogenetic and ecological considerations suggest that DT is a primitive character of land plants, lost in the course of evolution of the homoiohydric vascular-plant shoot system, but retained in spores, pollen and seeds, and re-evolved in the vegetative tissues of vascular “resurrection plants.” Bryophytes have retained the poikilohydry and DT that are probably the optimal pattern of adaptation at their scale, but modern bryophytes are specialized and diverse, and are removed by the same span of evolutionary time as the flowering plants from their primitive origins.'},\n",

In addition, the leaf ribs were covered with wax and an internal wax cuticle was observed. Biochemical analysis showed that the cyanidin 3-glucoside content increased on desiccation as did the trehalose and sucrose contents. Salt deposits were observed at the apices of desiccated leaves in the proximity of hydathode-like structures.

       "   'abstract': 'Few organisms are able to withstand desiccation stress; however, desiccation tolerance is widespread among plant seeds. Survival without water relies on an array of mechanisms, including the accumulation of stress proteins such as the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. These hydrophilic proteins are prominent in plant seeds but also found in desiccation-tolerant organisms. In spite of many theories and observations, LEA protein function remains unclear. Here, we show that LEAM, a mitochondrial LEA protein expressed in seeds, is a natively unfolded protein, which reversibly folds into α-helices upon desiccation. Structural modeling revealed an analogy with class A amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins that coat low-density lipoprotein particles in mammals. LEAM appears spontaneously modified by deamidation and oxidation of several residues that contribute to its structural features. LEAM interacts with membranes in the dry state and protects liposomes subjected to drying. The overall results provide strong evidence that LEAM protects the inner mitochondrial membrane during desiccation. According to sequence analyses of several homologous proteins from various desiccation-tolerant organisms, a similar protection mechanism likely acts with other types of cellular membranes.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract Bryophytes are a non-monophyletic group of three major lineages (liverworts, hornworts, and mosses) that descend from the earliest branching events in the phylogeny of land plants. We postulate that desiccation tolerance is a primitive trait, thus mechanisms by which the first land plants achieved tolerance may be reflected in how extant desiccation-tolerant bryophytes survive drying. Evidence is consistent with extant bryophytes employing a tolerance strategy of constitutive cellular protection coupled with induction of a recovery/repair mechanism upon rehydration. Cellular structures appear intact in the desiccated state but are disrupted by rapid uptake of water upon rehydration, but cellular integrity is rapidly regained. The photosynthetic machinery appears to be protected such that photosynthetic activity recovers quickly. Gene expression responds following rehydration and not during drying. Gene expression is translationally controlled and results in the synthesis of a number of proteins, collectively called rehydrins. Some prominent rehydrins are similar to Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins, classically ascribed a protection function during desiccation. The role of LEA proteins in a rehydrating system is unknown but data indicates a function in stabilization and reconstitution of membranes. Phylogenetic studies using a Tortula ruralis LEA-like rehydrin led to a re-examination of the evolution of desiccation tolerance. A new phylogenetic analysis suggests that: (i) the basic mechanisms of tolerance seen in modern day bryophytes have changed little from the earliest manifestations of desiccation tolerance in land plants, and (ii) vegetative desiccation tolerance in the early land plants may have evolved from a mechanism present first in spores.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract The loss of water from cells is a stress that was likely imposed very early in evolution. An understanding of the sensitivity or tolerance of cells to depletion of intracellular water is relevant to the study of quiescence, longevity and aging, because one consequence of air-drying is full metabolic arrest, sometimes for extended periods. When considering the adaptation of cells to physiological extremes of pH, temperature or pressure, it is generally assumed that evolution is driven toward optimum function rather than maximum stability. However, adaptation to desiccation has the singular and crucial distinction that dried cells do not grow, and the time the cell is dried may represent the greater part of the life (the time the cell remains viable) of that cell and its component macromolecules. Is a consideration of “function” relevant in the context of desiccated cells? The response of prokaryotic cells to desiccation, and the mechanisms they employ to tolerate this stress at the level of the cell, genome and proteome are considered. Fundamental principles were then implemented in the design of strategies to achieve air-dry stabilization of sensitive eukaryotic (human) cells. The responses of the transcriptomes and proteomes of prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells (yeast and human) to drying in air are compared and contrasted to achieve an evolutionary context. The concept of the “desiccome” is developed to question whether there is common set of structural, physiological and molecular mechanisms that constitute desiccation tolerance.'},\n",

They are poikilohydric organisms whose lifestyle in many cases consists of alternating periods of desiccation, with low metabolic activity, and hydration, which induces increase in their metabolism. Lichens have apparently adapted to such extreme transitions between desiccation and rehydration, but the mechanisms that govern these adaptations are still poorly understood. In this study, the effect of rehydration on the production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide as well as low-molecular-weight antioxidants was investigated with the lichen Ramalina lacera. Rehydration of R. lacera resulted in the initiation of and a rapid increase in photosynthetic activity. Recovery of photosynthesis was accompanied by bursts of intracellular production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy using dichlorofluorescein fluorescence revealed that formation of reactive oxygen species following rehydration was associated with both symbiotic partners of the lichen. The rate and extent of reactive oxygen species production were similar in the light and in the dark, suggesting a minor contribution of photosynthesis. Diaminofluorescein fluorescence, indicating nitric oxide formation, was detected only in fungal hyphae. Activities associated with rehydration did not have a deleterious effect on membrane integrity as assessed by measurement of electrolyte leakage, but water-soluble low-molecular-weight antioxidants decreased significantly.'},\n",

In the dry seed, more than 12 000 stored mRNA species were detected, including all ontological categories. Statistical analysis revealed that promoters of highly expressed genes in wild-type dry seeds overrepresented abscisic acid-responsive elements (ABREs) containing the core motif ACGT. Although the coupling element and seed-specific enhancer RY motif alone were not prominently overrepresented in genes with high expression, the presence of these elements in combination with ABRE was associated with particularly high gene expression. The transcriptome of the imbibed seeds differed from that of the dry seed even at 6 h after seed imbibition. After imbibition many upregulated and downregulated genes were co-regulated in clusters of three to five genes. Genes for which expression was affected by the abi5 mutation tended to be located in clusters, suggesting that transactivation by ABI5 is not restricted to a single gene, but affects other proximal genes. Furthermore, cytosine methylation was observed not only in large silent retrotransposon clusters in centromeric regions, but also in non-centromeric silent gene clusters in the seed. These results suggest that such regions might be transcriptionally silenced by methylation or heterochromatin structures.

Reduced ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) were consumed during the first 13 days of dehydration when guaiacol-, syringaldazine- and phenolic peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7) increased. At the end of dehydration AsA and GSH accumulated whereas peroxidases decreased to half the value of controls. In this period, plants of R. serbica face a phase of reduced metabolism and, thus, of reduced consumption of antioxidants. During rehydration, both AsA and GSH were utilized reaching, after 48 h, about 20 and 40% of their total pools, respectively; moreover peroxidases increased showing the recovery of metabolic activities. In the dehydration process total phenolic acids decreased, but accumulated after 5 h of rehydration and returned to control values at the end of rehydration. In R. serhica leaves, the most representative phenolic acids were protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic and chlorogenic acids. Most concentrated phenolic acids, such as protocatechuic and chlorogenic acids, accumulated during the first period of rehydration when AsA decreased. These results suggest a role of ascorbate in inhibiting oxidation when phenolic peroxidases remain at low levels. As a consequence of this inhibition, ascorbate was oxidized and when most of it was consumed, oxidation of phenols resumed.'},\n",

Besides the quantification of such a process, the development of tools is necessary in order to allow the identification of the primary cause of its development and localization. A biochemical method assessing 9 LOX, 13 LOX and ROS-mediated peroxidation of membrane-bound and free PUFAs has been improved. The assay is based on the analysis of hydroxy fatty acids derived from PUFA hydroperoxides by both the straight and chiral phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Besides the upstream products of peroxidation of the 18:2 and 18:3 PUFAs, products coming from the 16:3 were characterized and their steady-state level quantified. Moreover, the observation that the relative amounts of the ROS-mediated peroxidation isomers of 18:3 were constant in leaves allowed us to circumvent the chiral analyses for the discrimination and quantification of 9 LOX, 13 LOX and ROS-mediated processes in routine experiments. The methodology has been successfully applied to decipher lipid peroxidation in Arabidopsis leaves submitted to biotic and abiotic stresses. We provide evidence of the relative timing of enzymatic and non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation processes. The 13 LOX pathway is activated early whatever the nature of the stress, leading to the peroxidation of chloroplast lipids. Under cadmium stress, the 9 LOX pathway added to the 13 LOX one.

       "   'abstract': 'Seeds of many plant species are green during embryogenesis. To directly assess the influence of light on the physiological status of green oilseeds in planta, Brassica napus and soybean (Glycine max) seeds were rapidly dissected from plants growing in the light or dark. The activation state of malate dehydrogenase, which reflects reduced thioredoxin and NADP/NADPH ratios, was found to be as high in seeds exposed to light as in leaves and to decrease in the dark. Rubisco was highly activated (carbamylated) in both light and dark, most likely reflecting high seed CO2 concentrations. Activities of Rubisco and phosphoribulokinase were sufficient to account for significant refixation of CO2 produced during B. napus oil biosynthesis. To determine the influence of light on oil synthesis in planta, siliques on intact plants in full sunlight or detached siliques fed 3H2O were partly covered with aluminum foil. Seeds from light and dark sections were analyzed, and fatty acid accumulation was found to be higher in seeds exposed to light than seeds from dark sections. The spectrum of light filtering through silique walls and the pigment composition of developing B. napus embryos were determined. In addition to a low chlorophyll a/b ratio, the carotenoid pigments of seeds can provide additional capture of the green light that filters through siliques. Together, these results demonstrate that even the low level of light reaching seeds plays a substantial role in activating light-regulated enzymes, increasing fatty acid synthesis, and potentially powering refixation of CO2.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Leaf senescence is a highly regulated physiological process that leads to leaf death and is, as such, the last developmental stage of the leaf. Plant aging and environmental stresses may induce the process of senescence. Here we will focus on the role of leaf senescence in field-grown plants as a response to adverse climatic conditions and, more specifically, on how it contributes to plant survival under drought stress. Drought induces several responses in plants including leaf senescence, which plays a major role in the survival of several species. Drought-induced leaf senescence contributes to nutrient remobilisation during stress, thus allowing the rest of the plant (i.e. the youngest leaves, fruits or flowers) to benefit from the nutrients accumulated during the life span of the leaf. In addition, drought-induced leaf senescence, especially when accompanied by leaf abscission, avoids large losses through transpiration, thus contributing to the maintenance of a favourable water balance of the whole plant. Drought-induced leaf senescence occurs gradually and is characterised by specific macroscopic, cellular, biochemical and molecular changes. Leaf yellowing (i.e. chlorophyll degradation) and specific changes in cell ultrastructure (e.g. chromatin condensation, thylakoid swelling, plastoglobuli accumulation), metabolism (e.g.protein degradation, lipid peroxidation) and gene expression occur during leaf senescence in drought-stressed plants. Cytokinins and ABA have been shown to be involved in the regulation of drought-induced leaf senescence, although the possible role of other plant hormones should not be excluded. Reactive oxygen species, whose concentrations increase during drought-induced leaf senescence, are also known to be regulators of this process. The complex mechanisms of regulation of leaf senescence in drought-stressed plants are discussed, and attention is drawn to those aspects that still require investigation.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In the last decade, our understanding of the processes underlying plant response to drought, at the molecular and whole-plant levels, has rapidly progressed. Here, we review that progress. We draw attention to the perception and signalling processes (chemical and hydraulic) of water deficits. Knowledge of these processes is essential for a holistic understanding of plant resistance to stress, which is needed to improve crop management and breeding techniques. Hundreds of genes that are induced under drought have been identified. A range of tools, from gene expression patterns to the use of transgenic plants, is being used to study the specific function of these genes and their role in plant acclimation or adaptation to water deficit. However, because plant responses to stress are complex, the functions of many of the genes are still unknown. Many of the traits that explain plant adaptation to drought - such as phenology, root size and depth, hydraulic conductivity and the storage of reserves - are those associated with plant development and structure, and are constitutive rather than stress induced. But a large part of plant resistance to drought is the ability to get rid of excess radiation, a concomitant stress under natural conditions. The nature of the mechanisms responsible for leaf photoprotection, especially those related to thermal dissipation, and oxidative stress are being actively researched. The new tools that operate at molecular, plant and ecosystem levels are revolutionising our understanding of plant response to drought, and our ability to monitor it. Techniques such as genome-wide tools, proteomics, stable isotopes and thermal or fluorescence imaging may allow the genotype-phenotype gap to be bridged, which is essential for faster progress in stress biology research.'},\n",

Plasma membranes were isolated from leaves using a two-phase aqueous polymer partition system. Compared with well-hydrated (control) leaves, dehydrated leaves suffered a reduction of about 75% in their plasma membrane lipid content, which returned to the control level following rewatering. Also the lipid to protein ratio decreased after dehydration, almost regaining the initial value after rehydration. Lipids extracted from the plasma membrane of fully-hydrated leaves were characterized by a high level of free sterols and a much lower level of phospholipids. Smaller amounts of cerebrosides, acylated steryl glycosides and steryl glycosides were also detected. The main phospholipids of control leaves were phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas sitosterol was the free sterol present in the highest amount. Following dehydration, leaf plasma membrane lipids showed a constant level of free sterols and a reduction in phospholipids compared with the well-hydrated leaves. Both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine decreased following dehydration, their molar ratio remaining unchanged. Among free sterols, the remarkably high cholesterol level present in the control leaves (about 14 mol%) increased 2-fold as a result of dehydration. Dehydration caused a general decrease in the unsaturation level of individual phospholipids and total lipids as well. Upon rehydration the lipid composition of leaf plasma membranes restored very quickly approaching the levels of well-hydrated leaves.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Tortula ruralis (Syntrichia ruralis) is a useful model system for the study of gene control in response to severe water deficit-stress. EST gene discovery efforts utilizing desiccated gametophytes have identified two cDNAs designated Elipa and Elipb with significant similarity to early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs). Elipa is 1006 bp in length, encoding a 212 amino acid deduced polypeptide (ELIPa) with a predicted molecular mass of 23.3 kDa and pI of 5.57. Elipb is 997 bp in length, encoding a 224 amino acid deduced polypeptide (ELIPb) with a predicted molecular mass of 24.4 kDa and pI of 9.27. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that ELIPa and ELIPb are reproducibly grouped with ELIP sequences derived from desiccation-tolerance tissues. RNA blot hybridization was used to analyse Elipa and Elipb mRNA abundance in response to a variety of stresses. Elipa steady-state transcript levels increased in response to slow desiccation, rapid desiccation/rehydration, salinity, ABA, and rehydration in high light. The Elipb transcript was only detectable in response to ABA or rehydration in high light. It is postulated that ELIPa and ELIPb are an adaptive response to stress-induced photodamage within the moss chloroplast, and play a key role in the protection and/or repair of the photosynthetic apparatus.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Referee: Dr. Kozi Asada, Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Fukuyama University, Gakuencho 1, Fukuyama 729-0292, Japan Tocopherols and tocotrienols, which differ only in the degree of saturation of their hydrophobic prenyl side chains, are lipid-soluble molecules that have a number of functions in plants. Synthesized from homogentisic acid and isopentenyl diphosphate in the plastid envelope, tocopherols and tocotrienols are essential to maintain membrane integrity. α-Tocopherol is the major form found in green parts of plants, while tocotrienols are mostly found in seeds. These compounds are antioxidants, thus they protect the plant from oxygen toxicity. Tocopherols and tocotrienols scavenge lipid peroxy radicals, thereby preventing the propagation of lipid peroxidation in membranes, and the ensuing products tocopheroxyl and tocotrienoxyl radicals, respectively, are recycled back to tocopherols and tocotrienols by the concerted action of other antioxidants. Furthermore, tocopherols and tocotrienols protect lipids and other membrane components by physically quenching and reacting chemically with singlet oxygen. The scavenging of singlet oxygen by α-tocopherol in chloroplasts results in the formation of, among other products, α -tocopherol quinone, a known contributor to cyclic electron transport in thylakoid membranes, therefore providing photoprotection for chloroplasts. Moreover, given that α-tocopherol increases membrane rigidity, its concentration, together with that of the other membrane components, might be regulated to afford adequate fluidity for membrane function. Furthermore, α-tocopherol may affect intracellular signaling in plant cells. The effects of this compound in intracellular signaling may be either direct, by interacting with key components of the signaling cascade, or indirect, through the prevention of lipid peroxidation or the scavenging of singlet oxygen. In the latter case, α-tocopherol may regulate the concentration of reactive oxygen species and plant hormones, such as jasmonic acid, within the cell, which control both the growth and development of plants, and also plant response to stress.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract Embryonic axes of tea (desiccation sensitive) and pea (desiccation tolerant) were dried at different rates or stored at different water contents to distinguish between damage associated with the immediate effects of water loss and the longer-term effects of a partially hydrated state. No loss of viability was observed if pea axes were dried sufficiently rapidly (from 1.8 to 0.1 g H2O g-1dry mass (g/g) within 5 d). However, viability was lost in tea axes dried below 0.5 g/g (approximately -15 MPa) even if axes were dried within 1 h. Death in tea axes dried to moisture contents less than 0.5 g/g probably resulted from the removal of water necessary for cellular structural integrity (i.e. desiccation damage sensu stricto). When axes of both species were dried at slower rates, viability losses were observed at water potentials between about -3 and -15 MPa. The timing for this type of damage was species dependent, occurring within 2 d for tea and after 5 d for pea, and may be explained by higher oxidative activity in tea compared to pea. Embryos of both species with water potentials below -3 MPa were lethally damaged if oxygen consumption exceeded 1000–5000 μmol O2 g-1dry mass. Recalcitrant seeds are different than orthodox seeds because the former do not survive drying below a critical water content, regardless of the drying rate. Rapid drying is required for accurate assessment of the critical water content. Slow drying leads to metabolic imbalance and artefactual assessment of the critical water content for desiccation damage. Both tea and pea seeds were susceptible to damage from metabolic imbalances, suggesting that the predominant stress from slow drying is ageing.'},\n",

Two heterogeneous populations of ELIPs were obtained after chromatographic separation of solubilized thylakoid membranes using a weak anion exchange column.

To prove whether the isolated and pure forms of ELIP bind pigments, spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis were performed. Absorption spectra and TLC revealed the presence of chlorophyll a and lutein. Measurements of steady-state fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K exhibited a major peak at 674 nm typical for chlorophyll a bound to the protein matrix. The action spectrum of the fluorescence emission measured at 674 nm showed several peaks originating mainly from chlorophyll a.

Water loss caused a reduction in chlorophyll, carotenoid and lipid contents and an increase in conjugated dienes. In detached leaves, ultrastructure was also affected by dehydration, showing damaged cells with altered chloroplasts which retained large quantities of starch and lipid-like inclusions in the stroma. Upon rehydration a continuous degradation of the chemical composition and cell organization was observed with a further increase in peroxidation. Leaves dehydrated on the plant showed degradation of chlorophyll and lipids, whereas carotenoids increased and conjugated dienes decreased. Desiccation caused a vacuolar fragmentation and a decline in starch, whereas chloroplasts underwent slight alterations. Following rewatering a full recovery of chlorophyll and lipids occurred, while carotenoids and dienes remained constant. Starch increased in the chloroplasts and there was complete recovery of the ordered cell arrangement and chloroplast organization. Of the chloroplast polar lipids, in both sets of leaves desiccation caused a reduction only in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, while phospholipids showed an opposite pattern, increasing in air-dried leaves and decreasing in detached leaves.

       "   'abstract': 'The removal of cell-bound water through air drying and the addition of water to air-dried cells are forces that have played a pivotal role in the evolution of the prokaryotes. In bacterial cells that have been subjected to air drying, the evaporation of free cytoplasmic water (Vf) can be instantaneous, and an equilibrium between cell-bound water (Vb) and the environmental water (vapor) potential (psi wv) may be achieved rapidly. In the air-dried state some bacteria survive only for seconds whereas others can tolerate desiccation for thousands, perhaps millions, of years. The desiccated (anhydrobiotic) cell is characterized by its singular lack of water--with contents as low as 0.02 g of H2O g (dry weight)-1. At these levels the monolayer coverage by water of macromolecules, including DNA and proteins, is disturbed. As a consequence the mechanisms that confer desiccation tolerance upon air-dried bacteria are markedly different from those, such as the mechanism of preferential exclusion of compatible solutes, that preserve the integrity of salt-, osmotically, and freeze-thaw-stressed cells. Desiccation tolerance reflects a complex array of interactions at the structural, physiological, and molecular levels. Many of the mechanisms remain cryptic, but it is clear that they involve interactions, such as those between proteins and co-solvents, that derive from the unique properties of the water molecule. A water replacement hypothesis accounts for how the nonreducing disaccharides trehalose and sucrose preserve the integrity of membranes and proteins. Nevertheless, we have virtually no insight into the state of the cytoplasm of an air-dried cell. There is no evidence for any obvious adaptations of proteins that can counter the effects of air drying or for the occurrence of any proteins that provide a direct and a tangible contribution to cell stability. Among the prokaryotes that can exist as anhydrobiotic cells, the cyanobacteria have a marked capacity to do so. One form, Nostoc commune, encompasses a number of the features that appear to be critical to the withstanding of a long-term water deficit, including the elaboration of a conspicuous extracellular glycan, synthesis of abundant UV-absorbing pigments, and maintenance of protein stability and structural integrity. There are indications of a growing technology for air-dried cells and enzymes. Paradoxically, desiccation tolerance of bacteria has virtually been ignored for the past quarter century. The present review considers what is known, and what is not known, about desiccation, a phenomenon that impinges upon every facet of the distributions and activities of prokaryotic cells.'},\n",

Unusually large accumulations of astaxanthin esters in extra‐chloroplastic lipid globules produce the characteristics red pigmentation typical of some snow algae (e.g. Chlamydomonas nivalis (Bauer) Wille).

       "   'abstract': \"Most traits associated with drought tolerance have a dual effect, positive in very severe scenarios and negative in milder scenarios, or the opposite trend. Their effects also depend on other climatic conditions such as evaporative demand or light, and on management practices. This is the case for processes associated with cell protection and with avoidance, but also for the maintenance of growth or photosynthesis, high water use efficiency, large root systems or reduced abortion rate under water deficit. Therefore, spectacular results obtained in one drought scenario may have a limited interest for improving food security in other geographical areas with water scarcity. The most relevant questions on drought tolerance are probably, 'Does a given allele confer a positive effect on yield in an appreciable proportion of years/scenarios in a given area or target population of environment (TPE)?'; 'In a given site or TPE, what is the trade-off between risk avoidance and maintained performance?'; and 'Will a given allele or trait have an increasingly positive effect with climate change?' Considerable progress has already occurred in drought tolerance. Nevertheless, explicitly associating traits for tolerance to drought scenarios may have profound consequences on the genetic strategies, with a necessary involvement of modelling.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS\\nHaberlea rhodopensis is a perennial, herbaceous, saxicolous, poikilohydric flowering plant that is able to survive desiccation to air-dried state under irradiance below 30 micromol m-2 s-1. However, desiccation at irradiance of 350 micromol m-2 s-1 induced irreversible changes in the photosynthetic apparatus, and mature leaves did not recover after rehydration. The aim here was to establish the causes and mechanisms of irreversible damage of the photosynthetic apparatus due to dehydration at high irradiance, and to elucidate the mechanisms determining recovery.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nChanges in chloroplast structure, CO2 assimilation, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, fluorescence imaging and the polypeptide patterns during desiccation of Haberlea under medium (100 micromol m-2 s-1; ML) irradiance were compared with those under low (30 micromol m-2 s-1; LL) irradiance.\\n\\n\\nKEY RESULTS\\nWell-watered plants (control) at 100 micromol m-2 s-1 were not damaged. Plants desiccated at LL or ML had similar rates of water loss. Dehydration at ML decreased the quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry, and particularly the CO2 assimilation rate, more rapidly than at LL. Dehydration induced accumulation of stress proteins in leaves under both LL and ML. Photosynthetic activity and polypeptide composition were completely restored in LL plants after 1 week of rehydration, but changes persisted under ML conditions. Electron microscopy of structural changes in the chloroplast showed that the thylakoid lumen is filled with an electron-dense substance (dense luminal substance, DLS), while the thylakoid membranes are lightly stained. Upon dehydration and rehydration the DLS thinned and disappeared, the time course largely depending on the illumination: whereas DLS persisted during desiccation and started to disappear during late recovery under LL, it disappeared from the onset of dehydration and later was completely lost under ML.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAccumulation of DLS (possibly phenolics) in the thylakoid lumen is demonstrated and is proposed as a mechanism protecting the thylakoid membranes of H. rhodopensis during desiccation and recovery under LL. Disappearance of DLS during desiccation in ML could leave the thylakoid membranes without protection, allowing oxidative damage during dehydration and the initial rehydration, thus preventing recovery of photosynthesis.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'As there is limited information on the mechanisms of vegetative desiccation tolerance in pteridophytes, we undertook a comprehensive anatomical, ultrastructural, physiological and biochemical study on the fern Mohria caffrorum. Our data show that this species is desiccation-tolerant during the dry season, and desiccation-sensitive in the rainy season. This system allows the verification of protection mechanisms by comparison of tolerant and sensitive tissues of the same species at the same developmental age. Tolerant fronds acquire protection mechanisms during drying that are mostly similar to those reported for angiosperms. These include: (i) chlorophyll masking by abaxial scales and frond curling; (ii) increased antioxidant capacity that is maintained in dry tissues; (iii) mechanical stabilization of vacuoles in the dry state; (iv) de novo production of heat stable proteins (at least one identified as a putative chaperonin); (v) accumulation of protective carbohydrates (sucrose, raffinose family oligosaccharides and cyclitols). This study has implications for the biotechnological production of drought-tolerant crops, and allows speculation on the evolution of vegetative desiccation tolerance.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The vegetative tissues of resurrection plants, like seeds, can tolerate desiccation to 5% relative water content (RWC) for extended periods and yet resume full metabolic activity on re-watering. In this review we will illustrate how this is achieved in a variety of angiosperm resurrection plants, our studies ranging from the ecophysiological to the biochemical level. At the whole plant level, leaf folding and other anatomical changes serve to minimise light and mechanical stress associated with drying and rehydration. The mechanisms of cell wall folding are described for Craterostigma wilmsii and Myrothanmus flabellifolia. Free radicals, radical oxygen species (ROS) usually generated under water-deficit stress by photosynthesis, are minimised by either homoiochlorophylly (e.g. C. wilmsii and M. flabellifolia) or poikilochlorophylly (e.g. Xerophyta sp.). The antioxidant systems of these plants effectively deal with ROS generated by other metabolic processes. In addition to antioxidants common to most plants, resurrection plants also accumulate polyphenols such as 3, 4, 5 tri-O-galloylquinic acid in M. flabellifolia, and seed-associated antioxidants (e.g. 1-cys-peroxiredoxin and metallothionines) as effective ROS scavengers. Sucrose accumulates at low RWC, presumably protecting the sub-cellular milieu against desiccation-induced macromolecular denaturation. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________'},\n",

The structure was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. This compound was present at high concentrations, 44% (by weight) in hydrated leaves and 74% (by weight) in dehydrated leaves. Electron microscopy of leaf material fixed with glutaraldehyde and caffeine demonstrated that the polyphenols were localized in large vacuoles in both hydrated and dehydrated leaves. 3,4,5 Tri-O-galloylquinic acid was shown to stabilize an artificial membrane system, liposomes, against desiccation if the polyphenol concentration was between 1 and 2 microg/mug phospholipid. The phase transition of these liposomes observed at 46 degrees C was markedly diminished by the presence of 3,4,5 tri-O-galloylquinic acid, suggesting that the presence of the polyphenol maintained the membranes in the liquid crystalline phase at physiological temperatures. 3,4,5 Tri-O-galloylquinic acid was also shown to protect linoleic acid against free radical-induced oxidation.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The diploid grass Oropetium thomaeum, originally collected in south India, shows physiological and molecular features during dehydration and rehydration, which classify it as a resurrection plant. Dehydration is characterised by a partial loss of chlorophyll which is re-synthesised upon rehydration. High sucrose content in dehydrated tissues was correlated with synthesis of raffinose and even stachyose, whereas the concentrations of monosaccharides declined. Dehydration induced the synthesis of many gene products; for the purpose of this manuscript two prominent water stress proteins were investigated: the LEA dehydrin protein and an aldose reductase protein. The protein patterns in O. thomaeum were compared to dehydration sensitive monocots, in particular maize. In maize the aldose reductase protein was only expressed in desiccation tolerant embryos and declined during germination. In O. thomaeum, the proteins were abundant in desiccated but not in hydrated leaves. These results together with published observations suggest that the presence of aldose reductase protein can be considered as a marker for desiccation tolerant tissues in monocotyledonous plants. The characterization of O. thomaeum reveals that responses to dehydration are conserved and are similar to other resurrection plants. This feature in combination with the diploid genome could make it a suitable plant to genetically dissect the complexity of desiccation tolerance.'},\n",

The relative importance of g s and A pot , and how they are affected by WD, are reviewed with respect to light intensity and to experimental approaches. † Scope and Conclusions With progressive WD, A decreases as g s falls. Under low light during growth and WD, A is stimulated by elevated CO 2 , showing that metabolism (A pot) is not impaired, but at high light A is not stimulated , showing inhibition. At a given intercellular CO 2 concentration (C i) A decreases, showing impaired metabolism (A pot). The C i and probably chloroplast CO 2 concentration (C c), decreases and then increases, together with the equilibrium CO 2 concentration, with greater WD. Estimation of C c and internal (mesophyll) conductance (g i) is considered uncertain. Photosystem activity is unaffected until very severe WD, maintaining electron (e 2) transport (ET) and reductant content. Low A, together with photorespiration (PR), which is maintained or decreased, provides a smaller sink for e 2 , causing over-energization of energy transduction. Despite increased non-photoche-mical quenching (NPQ), excess energy and e 2 result in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence is considered that ROS damages ATP synthase so that ATP content decreases progressively with WD. Decreased ATP limits RuBP production by the Calvin cycle and thus A pot. Rubisco activity is unlikely to determine A pot. Sucrose synthesis is limited by lack of substrate and impaired enzyme regulation. With WD, PR decreases relative to light respiration (R L), and mitochondria consume reductant and synthesise ATP. With progressing WD at low A, R L increases C i and C c. This review emphasises the effects of light intensity, considers techniques, and develops a qualitative model of photosynthetic metabolism under WD that explains many observations: testable hypotheses are suggested.'},\n",

The mature leaves of the plant are capable of reviving after desiccation; they develop drought tolerances of 0% relative humidity (RH) under field conditions. The rate of drying is critically important for the development of desiccation tolerance. Drought-avoidance mechanisms (possibly related to the xeromorphic features of the plant) slow the rate of dehydration sufficiently for the development of full drought tolerance which requires completion of a time-dependent tolerance-endowing process in the range of water potential around 96% RH (90-98%), as well as avoidance of a slower time-dependent injurious process at water potentials of 75% RH and above. Non-senescent leaves that fulfil both requirements remain viable at water potentials below 50% RH for years. Dry viable leaves are yellow, owing to the loss of chlorophyll during the former process. Induction of drought tolerance at moderate water stress has been reported in other species, but Borya is remarkable for the extreme rapidity of the process and the degree of tolerance developed.'},\n",

Growing interest in this phenomenon has fueled recent physiological, biochemical, and genomic insights into the mechanistic basis of desiccation tolerance. Although, desiccation tolerance is often viewed as binary and monolithic, substantial variation exists in the phenotype and underlying mechanisms across diverse lineages, heterogeneous populations, and throughout the development of individual plants. Most studies have focused on conserved responses in a subset desiccation-tolerant plants under laboratory conditions. Consequently, the variability and natural diversity of desiccation-tolerant phenotypes remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we discuss the natural variation in desiccation tolerance and argue that leveraging this diversity can improve our mechanistic understanding of desiccation tolerance. We summarize information collected from ~600 desiccation-tolerant land plants and discuss the taxonomic distribution and physiology of\\xa0desiccation responses. We point out the need to quantify natural diversity of desiccation tolerance on three scales: variation across divergent lineages, intraspecific variation across populations, and variation across tissues and life stages of an individual plant. We conclude that this variability should be accounted for in experimental designs and can be leveraged for deeper insights into the intricacies of desiccation tolerance.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Tolerance to prolonged water deficit occurs along a continuum in plants, with dehydration and desiccation tolerance representing some of the most extreme adaptations to water scarcity. Although, dehydration and desiccation tolerance presumably vary among individuals of a single species, this variability remains largely unstudied. Here, we characterized expression dynamics throughout a dehydration - rehydration timecourse in six diverse genotypes of the dioecious liverwort\\xa0Marchantia inflexa. We identified classical signatures of stress response in M. inflexa, including major changes in transcripts related to metabolism, expression of LEA and ELIP genes, and evidence of cell wall remodeling. However, we detected very little temporal synchronization of these responses across different genotypes of\\xa0M. inflexa, which may be related to genotypic variation among samples, constitutive expression of dehydration associated transcripts, the sequestration of mRNAs in ribonucleoprotein partials prior to drying, or the lower tolerance of M. inflexa relative to most bryophytes studied to date. Our characterization of intraspecific variation in expression dynamics suggests that differences in the timing of transcriptional adjustments contribute to variation among genotypes, and that developmental differences impact the relative tolerance of meristematic and differentiated tissues. This work highlights the complexity and variability of water stress tolerance and underscores the need for comparative studies that seek to characterize variation in desiccation and dehydration tolerance.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In the last decade, several works showed that even bryophytes from aquatic environments, if slowly dehydrated, can cope with desiccation in a response like the one from desert bryophytes. This led to the hypothesis that, if bryophytes from contrasting habitats can have similar responses, desiccation tolerance (DT) is partially inductive and not only constitutive as previously proposed and, therefore, colony morphology might be the key trait responsible for controlling dehydration rate essential for DT induction. Morphology and life form may be determinant traits in the adaptation of bryophytes to habitats with different water availabilities and corresponding predicted levels in the DT inducibility spectrum. Bryophytes from habitats with different water availabilities were dried as individual shoots and as a colony. The bryophyte Fontinalis antipyretica is fully aquatic presenting a streamer life form, while the three terrestrial species present turf life form with different sizes and degrees of space between individuals in the colony. Two species were collected under trees with moist soil presenting short turf (Tortella tortuosa) and long turf (Campylopus pyriformis) life forms. Another species was completely exposed to sun light with no surrounding trees and a tall turf life form (Pleurochaete squarrosa). We used chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm (maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II) as a proxy to photosynthetic fitness throughout the contrasting dehydration rates (fast and slow). These bryophytes with different life forms were submitted to an X-ray computed microtomography (µ-XCT) to assess the three-dimensional inner structure and visualize locations for water storage. Shoots dried slow or fast according to the dehydration they were exposed to, as expected, but they presented similar dehydration rates across different species. However, the aquatic moss F. antipyretica, was unable to recover from fast drying, and after 24 h the recovery following slow drying was lower than the other species. The other three species presented full recovery after 24 h, either at the individual or colony level, and either from slow or fast drying. The only exception was the colonies of Campylopus pyriformis following fast drying that presented a slightly lower recovery, probably due to a looser colony structure.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Desiccation Tolerance in Chlorophyllous Fern Spores: Are Ecophysiological Features Related to Environmental Conditions?',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Fern spores of most species are desiccation tolerant (DT) and, in some cases, are photosynthetic at maturation, the so-called chlorophyllous spores (CS). The lifespan of CS in the dry state is very variable among species. The physiological, biochemical, and biophysical mechanisms underpinning this variability remain understudied and their interpretation from an ecophysiological approach virtually unexplored. In this study, we aimed at fulfilling this gap by assessing photochemical, hydric, and biophysical properties of CS from three temperate species with contrasting biological strategies and longevity in the dry state: Equisetum telmateia (spore maturation and release in spring, ultrashort lifespan), Osmunda regalis (spore maturation and release in summer, medium lifespan), Matteuccia struthiopteris (spore maturation and release in winter, medium-long lifespan). After subjection of CS to controlled drying treatments, results showed that the three species displayed different extents of DT. CS of E. telmateia rapidly lost viability after desiccation, while the other two withstood several dehydration–rehydration cycles without compromising viability. The extent of DT was in concordance with water availability in the sporulation season of each species. CS of O. regalis and M. struthiopteris carried out the characteristic quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, widely displayed by other DT cryptogams during drying, and had higher tocopherol and proline contents. The turgor loss point of CS is also related to the extent of DT and to the sporulation season: lowest values were found in CS of M. struthiopteris and O. regalis. The hydrophobicity of spores in these two species was higher and probably related to the prevention of water absorption under unfavorable conditions. Molecular mobility, estimated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, confirmed an unstable glassy state in the spores of E. telmateia, directly related to the low DT, while the DT species entered in a stable glassy state when dried. Overall, our data revealed a DT syndrome related to the season of sporulation that was characterized by higher photoprotective potential, specific hydric properties, and lower molecular mobility in the dry state. Being unicellular haploid structures, CS represent not only a challenge for germplasm preservation (e.g., as these spores are prone to photooxidation) but also an excellent opportunity for studying mechanisms of DT in photosynthetic cells.'},\n",

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15553/c2019v741a8 Inselbergs are isolated mountains, mainly granitic or gneissic rock outcrops rising abruptly above surrounding plains. Malagasy inselbergs are often dome-shaped and occur in varying degrees of isolation, but they sometimes form inselberg landscapes, which comprise dozens of individual outcrops. Despite being typical landscape features on Madagascar's high plateau, little data are available on their detailed plant cover. Recent extensive fieldwork, which was conducted between 2010 and 2014, mainly on the central plateau, has resulted in a better knowledge about the floristic composition and habitats of Malagasy inselbergs. The most speciose vascular plant genera were Cynorkis Thouars (18), Cyperus L. (15) and Euphorbia L. (14). Malagasy inselbergs are centres of diversity for succulents (notably species of the genera Aloe L., Euphorbia and Kalanchoe Adans.), carnivorous plants (species of Drosera L. and Utricularia L.) and resurrection plants (notably species of Xerophyta Juss.). The most speciose habitat types were ephemeral flush vegetation and monocotyledonous mats. The latter habitat supports a large number of succulents and resurrection plants. In total 724 taxa out of 338 genera and 107 families have been recorded. Moreover, the variability in floristic composition between different regions is remarkable. Detrimental human impacts include quarrying, grazing, fire and the collection of plants for ornamental purposes (species of Pachypodium Lindl. and Orchidaceae) and as medicine (species of Aloe, Drosera madagascariensis DC., Myrothamnus moschatus (Baill.) Baill.). For the first time, recommendations are made for the conservation of Malagasy inselbergs.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Resurrection plants possess a unique ability to counteract desiccation stress. Desiccation tolerance (DT) is a very complex multigenic and multifactorial process comprising a combination of physiological, morphological, cellular, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic processes. Modification in the sugar composition of the hemicellulosic fraction of the cell wall is detected during dehydration. An important change is a decrease of glucose in the hemicellulosic fraction during dehydration that can reflect a modification of the xyloglucan structure. The expansins might also be involved in cell wall flexibility during drying and disrupt hydrogen bonds between polymers during rehydration of the cell wall. Cleavages by xyloglucan-modifying enzymes release the tightly bound xyloglucan-cellulose network, thus increasing cell wall flexibility required for cell wall folding upon desiccation. Changes in hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) such as arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are also observed during desiccation and rehydration processes. It has also been observed that significant alterations in the process of photosynthesis and photosystem (PS) II activity along with changes in the antioxidant enzyme system also increased the cell wall and membrane fluidity resulting in DT. Similarly, recent data show a major role of ABA, LEA proteins, and small regulatory RNA in regulating DT responses. Current progress in “-omic” technologies has enabled quantitative monitoring of the plethora of biological molecules in a high throughput routine, making it possible to compare their levels between desiccation-sensitive and DT species. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of structural, physiological, cellular, molecular, and global responses involved in desiccation tolerance.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The desiccation-tolerant (DT) plants are poikilohydric and capable of surviving the loss of 90-95% of their cell water content. DT plants are important constituents of many ecosystems from the arctic (lichen and moss vegetations) to the tropics (lichen, moss and flower vegetations). Desiccation-tolerant (DT) plants may be subdivided into homoiochlorophyllous (HDT) and poikilochlorophyllous (PDT) types. The HDTs retain their chlorophyll on desiccation, whereas in PDTs desiccation results in the loss of chlorophyll, which must be resynthetized fol- lowing remoistening. The PDT strategy can be seen an the evolutionarily different new strategy. It is based on the dismantling of internal chloroplast structure by an ordered deconstruction process during drying, and its resynthesis upon rehydration. The selective advantage of poikilo- chlorophylly is in minimising photo-oxidative damage and not having to maintain an intact photosynthetic system through long (5-10 months) inactive periods of desiccation. Taxonomically the PDT plants appear to be restricted to the monocots.

       "   'abstract': 'The vegetative tissues of resurrection plants, like seeds, can tolerate desiccation to 5% relative water content (RWC) for extended periods and yet resume full metabolic activity on re-watering. In this review we will illustrate how this is achieved in a variety of angiosperm resurrection plants, our studies ranging from the ecophysiological to the biochemical level. At the whole plant level, leaf folding and other anatomical changes serve to minimise light and mechanical stress associated with drying and rehydration. The mechanisms of cell wall folding are described for Craterostigma wilmsii and Myrothanmus flabellifolia. Free radicals, radical oxygen species (ROS) usually generated under water-deficit stress by photosynthesis, are minimised by either homoiochlorophylly (e.g. C. wilmsii and M. flabellifolia) or poikilochlorophylly (e.g. Xerophyta sp.). The antioxidant systems of these plants effectively deal with ROS generated by other metabolic processes. In addition to antioxidants common to most plants, resurrection plants also accumulate polyphenols such as 3, 4, 5 tri-O-galloylquinic acid in M. flabellifolia, and seed-associated antioxidants (e.g. 1-cys-peroxiredoxin and metallothionines) as effective ROS scavengers. Sucrose accumulates at low RWC, presumably protecting the sub-cellular milieu against desiccation-induced macromolecular denaturation. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Within the monocotyledons the acquisition of the tree habit is enhanced by either primary growth of the axis or a distinctive mode of secondary growth. However, a few arborescent monocotyledons deviate from this pattern in developing trunks up to four meters high that resemble those of tree ferns, i.e., their \"woody-fibrous\" stems consist mainly of persistent leaf bases and adventitious roots. This type of arborescent monocotyledon occurs in both tropical and temperate regions and is found within Boryaceae (Borya), Cyperaceae (Afrotrilepis, Bulbostylis, Coleochloa, Microdracoides), and Velloziaceae (e.g., Vellozia, Xerophyta). They have developed in geographically widely separated regions with most of them occurring in the tropics and only Borya being a temperate zone outlier. These mostly miniature \"lily trees\" frequently occur in edaphically and climatologically extreme habitats (e.g., rock outcrops, white sand savannas). Characterized by a high degree of desiccation tolerance and a certain amount of fire-resistance, these plants are xerophytes that among vascular plants possess a unique combination of ecophysiological and morphoanatomical adaptations (e.g., poikilohydry, roots with velamen radicum). Moreover, most \"lily trees\" tend to form clonal populations of considerable age by means of stolons or by basal branching, which provides substantial advantages for the rapid and long lasting occupation of suitable sites. A summary is given of the major vegetative traits that obviously evolved independently within Boryaceae, Cyperaceae, and Velloziaceae.'},\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Desiccation of plants is often lethal but is tolerated by the majority of seeds and by vegetative tissues of only a small number of land plants. Desiccation tolerance is an ancient trait, lost from vegetative tissues following the appearance of tracheids but reappearing in several lineages when selection pressures favored its evolution. Cells of all desiccation-tolerant plants and seeds must possess a core set of mechanisms to protect them from desiccation- and rehydration-induced damage. This review explores how desiccation generates cell damage and how tolerant cells assuage the complex array of mechanical, structural, metabolic, and chemical stresses and survive. Likewise, the stress of rehydration requires appropriate mitigating cellular responses. We also explore what comparative genomics, both structural and responsive, have added to our understanding of cellular protection mechanisms induced by desiccation, and how vegetative desiccation tolerance circumvents destructive, stress-induced cell senescence. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Plant Biology, Volume 71 is April 29, 2020. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.',\n",

Desiccation-tolerant (DT) plants may be subdivided into homoiochlorophyllous (HDT) and poikilochlorophyllous (PDT) types. The HDTs retain their chlorophyll on desiccation, whereas in PDTs desiccation results in the loss of chlorophyll, which must be resynthetized fol- lowing remoistening. The PDT strategy can be seen an the evolutionarily different new strategy. It is based on the dismantling of internal chloroplast structure by an ordered deconstruction process during drying, and its resynthesis upon rehydration. The selective advantage of poikilo- chlorophylly is in minimising photo-oxidative damage and not having to maintain an intact photosynthetic system through long (5-10 months) inactive periods of desiccation. Taxonomically the PDT plants appear to be restricted to the monocots.

       " 'Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins comprise a diverse family whose members play a key role in abiotic stress tolerance. As intrinsically disordered proteins, LEA proteins are highly hydrophilic and inherently stress tolerant. They have been shown to stabilise multiple client proteins under a variety of stresses, but current hypotheses do not fully explain how such broad range stabilisation is achieved. Here, using neutron reflection and surface tension experiments, we examine in detail the mechanism by which model LEA proteins, AavLEA1 and ERD10, protect the enzyme citrate synthase (CS) from aggregation during freeze–thaw. We find that a major contributing factor to CS aggregation is the formation of air bubbles during the freeze–thaw process. This greatly increases the air–water interfacial area, which is known to be detrimental to folded protein stability. Both model LEA proteins preferentially adsorb to this interface and compete with CS, thereby reducing surface-induced aggregation. This novel surface activity provides a general mechanism by which diverse members of the LEA protein family might function to provide aggregation protection that is not specific to the client protein.',\n",

Despite its apparent simplicity, there are many features (ranging from task design to data analysis) that vary across studies in ways that can easily compromise the validity of the obtained results. Our goal is to facilitate a more accurate use of the stop-signal task. To this end, we provide 12 easy-to-implement consensus recommendations and point out the problems that can arise when they are not followed.

A literature score of one has been defined as full publication equivalent (FPE), the amount of literature necessary to achieve one publication solely dedicated to a gene. It has been found that less than 5000 human genes have each at least 100 FPEs in the available literature corpus. This group of elite genes (4817 protein‐coding genes, 119 non‐coding RNAs) attracts the overwhelming majority of the scientific literature about genes. Yet, thousands of proteins have never been mentioned at all, ≈2000 further proteins have not even one FPE of literature and, for ≈4600 additional proteins, the FPE count is below 10. The protein function discovery rate measured as numbers of proteins first mentioned or crossing a threshold of accumulated FPEs in a given year has grown until 2000 but is in decline thereafter. This drop is partially offset by function discoveries for non‐coding RNAs. The full human genome sequencing does not boost the function discovery rate. Since 2000, the fastest growing group in the literature is that with at least 500 FPEs per gene.',\n",
       " 'This review compares the molecular strategies employed by anhydrobiotic invertebrates to survive extreme water stress. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play a central role in desiccation tolerance in all species investigated. Various hypotheses about the functions of anhydrobiosis‐related intrinsically disordered (ARID) proteins, including late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) and tardigrade‐specific intrinsically disordered proteins, are evaluated by broad sequence characterization. A surprisingly wide range in sequence characteristics, including hydropathy and the frequency and distribution of charges, is discovered. Interestingly, two clusters of similar proteins are found that potentially correlate with distinct functions. This may indicate two broad groups of ARID proteins, composed of one group that folds into functional conformations during desiccation and a second group that potentially displays functions in the hydrated state. A broad range of physiochemical properties suggest that folding may be induced by factors such as hydration level, molecular crowding, and interactions with binding partners. This plasticity may be required to fine‐tune the ARID‐proteome response at different hydration levels during desiccation. Furthermore, the sequence properties of some LEA proteins share qualities with IDPs known to undergo liquid–liquid phase separations during environmental challenges.',\n",

These include near ubiquitous pathological inclusions of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TDP-43, and often the presence of a GGGGCC expansion in the C9ORF72 (C9) gene. Previously, we reported that the sequestration of hnRNP H altered the splicing of target transcripts in C9ALS patients (Conlon et al., 2016). Here, we show that this signature also occurs in half of 50 postmortem sporadic, non-C9 ALS/FTD brains. Furthermore, and equally surprisingly, these ‘like-C9’ brains also contained correspondingly high amounts of insoluble TDP-43, as well as several other disease-related RBPs, and this correlates with widespread global splicing defects. Finally, we show that the like-C9 sporadic patients, like actual C9ALS patients, were much more likely to have developed FTD. We propose that these unexpected links between C9 and sporadic ALS/FTD define a common mechanism in this disease spectrum.',\n",

This segregation allows AHs to adsorb at polar–apolar interfaces such as the lipid surfaces of cellular organelles. Using various examples, we discuss here how variations within this general scheme impart membrane-interacting AHs with different interfacial properties. Among the key parameters are: (i) the size of hydrophobic residues and their density per helical turn; (ii) the nature, the charge, and the distribution of polar residues; and (iii) the length of the AH. Depending on how these parameters are tuned, AHs can deform lipid bilayers, sense membrane curvature, recognize specific lipids, coat lipid droplets, or protect membranes from stress. Via these diverse mechanisms, AHs play important roles in many cellular processes.',\n",

We show that these two molecules help to stabilize the activity and prevent aggregation of model proteins both in vivo and in vitro.

Such a study provides information about the effect of extreme environmental conditions on biological membranes and, in particular, on lipidic microdomains. Dehydration stress, indeed, is thought to cause both macroscopical damage and alterations of microdomains in biomembranes, leading to deleterious effects. These phenomena can be avoided if disaccharides are added during dehydration. In this work, we apply AFM imaging to directly visualize damage caused to supported lipid bilayers by water removal. We compare the efficiency of sucrose, trehalose, dextran, dimethyl sulfoxide, and glucose in preserving the structural integrity of domain-exhibiting model membranes. Finally, in addition to confirming previous findings, our results provide further insight into damage and alteration of microdomains in membranes as a consequence of stressful drying conditions.',\n",

Several studies have attempted to understand how trehalose interacts with biomolecules. To address this problem, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of carboxy-myoglobin embedded in a trehalose aqueous solution and in a trehalose–water plasticized amorphous matrix. The results show that, in an aqueous solution, trehalose is excluded from the protein domain.

In the presence of trehalose, dry dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) had a transition temperature similar to that of the fully hydrated lipid, whereas DPPC dried without trehalose had a transition temperature about 30 degrees Kelvin higher. Results obtained with infrared spectroscopy indicate that trehalose and DPPC interact by hydrogen bonding between the OH groups in the carbohydrate and the polar head groups of DPPC. These and previous results show that this hydrogen bonding alters the spacing of the polar head groups and may thereby decrease van der Waals interactions in the hydrocarbon chains of the DPPC. This interaction between trehalose and DPPC is specific to trehalose.

Evidence is presented for the existence of five mRNA subsets, all apparently under different regulatory regimes, that produce the abundant proteins of embryogenesis. One of these functions principally during the cell division phase of embryogenesis and encodes among its products the seed storage proteins whose mRNA is superabundant during this period. This subset has disappeared from the abundant group by the mature seed stage. Two other subsets appear in late embryogenesis, one of which may result from the removal of the embryo from the maternal environment, since it is inducible by excision of the young embryo from the seed. The other appears to be induced by the plant growth regulator abscisic acid, whose endogenous concentration increases at this stage. It can be induced by incubating excised young embryos in abscisic acid. The last two subsets exist throughout embryogenesis, but only one of them appears to function in germination.',\n",

We focus on how LEAPs may protect a stress-susceptible proteome. These examples include instances of LEAPs providing a shield molecule function, possibly by instigating liquid-liquid phase separations. Some LEAPs bind directly to their client proteins, exerting a holdase-type chaperonin function. Finally, instances of LEAP–client protein interactions have been documented, where the LEAP modulates (interferes with) the function of the client protein, acting as a surreptitious rheostat of cellular homeostasis. From the examples identified to date, it is apparent that client protein modulation also serves to mitigate stress. While some LEAPs can physically bind and protect client proteins, some apparently bind to assist the degradation of the client proteins with which they associate. Documented instances of LEAP–client protein binding, even in the absence of stress, brings to the fore the necessity of identifying how the LEAPs are degraded post-stress to render them innocuous, a first step in understanding how the cell regulates their abundance.',\n",

Stress assemblies play key roles in survival during cell stress and in thriving of cells upon stress relief. The two best studied stress assemblies are the RNA‐based processing‐bodies (P‐bodies) and stress granules that form in response to oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), osmotic and nutrient stress as well as many others. Interestingly, P‐bodies and stress granules are heterogeneous with respect to both the pathways that lead to their formation and their protein and RNA content. Furthermore, in yeast and Drosophila, nutrient stress also leads to the formation of many other types of prosurvival cytoplasmic stress assemblies, such as metabolic enzymes foci, proteasome storage granules, EIF2B bodies, U‐bodies and Sec bodies, some of which are not RNA‐based.

Fluorescently-tagged Akt reporters have been used to discern Akt localisation, yet it has not been clear how well these tools recapitulate the behaviour of endogenous Akt proteins. Here, we observed that fusion of eGFP to Akt2 impaired both its insulin-stimulated plasma membrane recruitment and its phosphorylation. Endogenous-like responses were restored by replacing eGFP with TagRFP-T. The improved response magnitude and sensitivity afforded by TagRFP-T–Akt2 over eGFP–Akt2 enabled monitoring of signalling outcomes in single cells at physiological doses of insulin with subcellular resolution and revealed two previously unreported features of Akt biology. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, stimulation with insulin resulted in recruitment of Akt2 to the plasma membrane in a polarised fashion. Additionally, we observed oscillations in plasma membrane localised Akt2 in the presence of insulin with a consistent periodicity of 2\\u2005min. Our studies highlight the importance of fluorophore choice when generating reporter constructs and shed light on new Akt signalling responses that may encode complex signalling information.

The thermotropic response of the wavelength dependent fluorescence lifetime of the probe with a rise time in the longer wavelength region has enabled monitoring of the microheterogeneity of the gel medium. With an increase in temperature, the microviscosity progressively increases from ∼10 mPa s (sol state) to ∼23 mPa s (gel state).

       " 'The coordinated growth of cells and their organelles is a fundamental and poorly understood problem, with implications for processes ranging from embryonic development to oncogenesis. Recent experiments have shed light on the cell size–dependent assembly of membrane-less cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic structures, including ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules and other intracellular bodies. Many of these structures behave as condensed liquid-like phases of the cytoplasm/nucleoplasm. The phase transitions that appear to govern their assembly exhibit an intrinsic dependence on cell size, and may explain the size scaling reported for a number of structures. This size scaling could, in turn, play a role in cell growth and size control.',\n",

       " \"Species interactions play key roles in linking the responses of populations, communities, and ecosystems to environmental change. For instance, species interactions are an important determinant of the complexity of changes in trophic biomass with variation in resources. Water resources are a major driver of terrestrial ecology and climate change is expected to greatly alter the distribution of this critical resource. While previous studies have documented strong effects of global environmental change on species interactions in general, responses can vary from region to region. Dryland ecosystems occupy more than one‐third of the Earth's land mass, are greatly affected by changes in water availability, and are predicted to be hotspots of climate change. Thus, it is imperative to understand the effects of environmental change on these globally significant ecosystems.\",\n",

       " 'Theory suggests it should be difficult for asexual organisms to adapt to a changing environment because genetic diversity can only arise from mutations accumulating within direct antecedents and not through sexual exchange. In an asexual microinvertebrate, the bdelloid rotifer, we have observed a mechanism by which such organisms could acquire the diversity needed for adaptation. Gene copies most likely representing former alleles have diverged in function so that the proteins they encode play complementary roles in survival of dry conditions. One protein prevents desiccation-sensitive enzymes from aggregating during drying, whereas its counterpart does not have this activity, but is able to associate with phospholipid bilayers and is potentially involved in maintenance of membrane integrity. The functional divergence of former alleles observed here suggests that adoption of asexual reproduction could itself be an evolutionary mechanism for the generation of diversity.',\n",
       " 'The creation and application of proteins with desirable properties would benefit significantly from strategies to reduce the problem of protein aggregation. Here we demonstrate “supercharging” the surface of three disparate proteins to alter their net charge by as much as 55 charge units, without destroying protein folding or function. These supercharged variants acquire unusual resistance to aggregation and, unlike their natural counterparts, can refold and function even after boiling. Our findings demonstrate an approach to increasing protein robustness, suggest surprisingly broad, untapped plasticity at protein surfaces, and may help explain the modest net-charge distribution of natural proteins.',\n",

       " 'The absorbance and fluorescence spectra of Nile Red (NR) were examined in a series of nonpolar solvents comprising linear alkanes and a range of poly alpha olefins (PAO). These solvents span a 1000-fold range in viscosity and possess very similar dielectric constants and refractive index properties. A high-energy double peak with vibronic structure is observed in both fluorescence and absorbance spectra, possibly indicating that a locally excited (LE) state is accessed in these solvents. In addition, a red shift in peak position is observed with increasing refractive index; however, it is unaccompanied by any changes in Stokes shift. This shift is attributed to changes in the high-frequency polarizability of the solvent, which is a function of the refractive index. Finally, an increase in quantum yield with viscosity is also observed.',\n",
       " 'Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) restrict the nucleocytoplasmic flux of most macromolecules, but permit facilitated passage of nuclear transport receptors and their cargo complexes. We found that a simple hydrophobic interaction column can mimic the selectivity of NPCs surprisingly well and that nuclear transport receptors appear to be the most hydrophobic soluble proteins. This suggests that surface hydrophobicity represents a major sorting criterion of NPCs. The rate of NPC passage of cargo–receptor complexes is, however, not dominated just by properties of the receptors. We found that large cargo domains drastically hinder NPC passage and require more than one receptor molecule for rapid translocation. This argues against a rigid translocation channel and instead suggests that NPC passage involves a partitioning of the entire translocating species into a hydrophobic phase, whereby the receptor:cargo ratio determines the solubility in that permeability barrier. Finally, we show that interfering with hydrophobic interactions causes a reversible collapse of the permeability barrier of NPCs, which is consistent with the assumption that the barrier is formed by phenylalanine‐rich nucleoporin repeats that attract each other through hydrophobic interactions.',\n",
       " 'We report that the dye nile red, 9-diethylamino-5H- benzo[alpha]phenoxazine-5-one, is an excellent vital stain for the detection of intracellular lipid droplets by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytofluorometry. The specificity of the dye for lipid droplets was assessed on cultured aortic smooth muscle cells and on cultured peritoneal macrophages that were incubated with acetylated low density lipoprotein to induce cytoplasmic lipid overloading. Better selectivity for cytoplasmic lipid droplets was obtained when the cells were viewed for yellow-gold fluorescence (excitation, 450-500 nm; emission, greater than 528 nm) rather than red fluorescence (excitation, 515-560 nm; emission, greater than 590 nm). Nile red-stained, lipid droplet-filled macrophages exhibited greater fluorescence intensity than did nile red- stained control macrophages, and the two cell populations could be differentiated and analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Such analyses could be performed with either yellow-gold or red fluorescence, but when few lipid droplets per cell were present, the yellow-gold fluorescence was more discriminating. Nile red exhibits properties of a near-ideal lysochrome. It is strongly fluorescent, but only in the presence of a hydrophobic environment. The dye is very soluble in the lipids it is intended to show, and it does not interact with any tissue constituent except by solution. Nile red can be applied to cells in an aqueous medium, and it does not dissolve the lipids it is supposed to reveal.',\n",

       " 'More than 70% of the global food supply depends on seeds. The major seed reserves, such as proteins, lipids and polysaccharides, are produced during seed maturation. Here we report that DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1)-LIKE4 (DOGL4) is a major inducer of reserve accumulation during seed maturation. The DOGL family proteins are plant-specific proteins of largely unknown biochemical function. DOGL4 shares only limited homology in amino acid sequence to DOG1, a major regulator of seed dormancy. DOGL4 was identified as one of the outstanding abscisic acid (ABA)-induced genes in our RNA sequencing analysis while DOG1 was not induced by ABA. Induction of DOGL4 caused expression of 70 seed maturation-specific genes even in germinating seeds, including the major seed reserves ALBUMIN, CRUCIFERIN and OLEOSIN. While DOG1 affects the expression of many seed maturation genes, the major seed reserve genes induced by DOGL4 are not altered by the dog1 mutation. Furthermore, the reduced dormancy and longevity phenotypes observed in the dog1 seeds were not observed in the dogl4 mutants, suggesting that these two genes have limited functional overlap. Taken together, these results suggest that DOGL4 is a central factor mediating reserve accumulation in seeds and that the two DOG1 family proteins have diverged over the course of evolution into independent regulators of seed maturation, with retaining some overlapping function.',\n",
       " \"Seed development is a complex period of the flowering plant life cycle. After fertilization, the three main regions of the seed, embryo, endosperm and seed coat, undergo a series of developmental processes that result in the production of a mature seed that is developmentally arrested, desiccated, and metabolically quiescent. These processes are highly coordinated, both temporally and spatially, to ensure the proper growth and development of the seed. The transcription factor, LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), is a central regulator that controls several aspects of embryo and endosperm development, including embryo morphogenesis, photosynthesis, and storage reserve accumulation. Thus, LEC1 regulates distinct sets of genes at different stages of seed development. Despite its critical importance for seed development, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying LEC1's multifunctionality is only beginning to be obtained. Recent studies describe the roles of specific transcription factors and the hormones, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid, in controlling the activity and transcriptional specificity of LEC1 across seed development. Moreover, studies indicate that LEC1 acts as a pioneer transcription factor to promote epigenetic reprogramming during embryogenesis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that enable LEC1 to serve as a central regulator of seed development.\",\n",

       " 'Seeds represent the major source of food protein, impacting on both human nutrition and animal feeding. Therefore, seed quality needs to be appropriately addressed in the context of viability and food safety. Indeed, long-term and inappropriate storage of seeds might result in enhancement of protein glycation, which might affect their quality and longevity. Glycation of seed proteins can be probed by exhaustive acid hydrolysis and quantification of the glycation adduct Nɛ-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This approach, however, does not allow analysis of thermally and chemically labile glycation adducts, like glyoxal-, methylglyoxal- and 3-deoxyglucosone-derived hydroimidazolones. Although enzymatic hydrolysis might be a good solution in this context, it requires aqueous conditions, which cannot ensure reconstitution of seed protein isolates. Because of this, the complete profiles of seed advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are not characterized so far. Therefore, here we propose the approach, giving access to quantitative solubilization of seed proteins in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and their quantitative enzymatic hydrolysis prior to removal of SDS by reversed phase solid phase extraction (RP-SPE). Using methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 (MG-H1) as a case example, we demonstrate the applicability of this method for reliable and sensitive LC-MS-based quantification of chemically labile AGEs and its compatibility with bioassays.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins include eight multigene families that are expressed in response to water loss during seed maturation and in vegetative tissues of desiccation tolerant species. To elucidate LEA proteins evolution and diversification, we performed a comprehensive synteny and phylogenetic analyses of the eight gene families across 60 complete plant genomes. Our integrated comparative genomic approach revealed that synteny conservation and diversification contributed to LEA family expansion and functional diversification in plants. We provide examples that: 1) the genomic diversification of the Dehydrin family contributed to differential evolution of amino acid sequences, protein biochemical properties, and gene expression patterns, and led to the appearance of a novel functional motif in angiosperms; 2) ancient genomic diversification contributed to the evolution of distinct intrinsically disordered regions of LEA_1 proteins; 3) recurrent tandem-duplications contributed to the large expansion of LEA_2; and 4) dynamic synteny diversification played a role on the evolution of LEA_4 and its function on plant desiccation tolerance. Taken together, these results show that multiple evolutionary mechanisms have not only led to genomic diversification but also to structural and functional plasticity among LEA proteins which have jointly contributed to the adaptation of plants to water-limiting environments.',\n",

Moonlighting proteins contain two or more physiologically relevant distinct functions performed by a single polypeptide chain. Here, we describe developments in the MoonProt website and database since our previous report in the Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research. For this V 2.0 release, we expanded the number of proteins annotated to 370 and modified several dozen protein annotations with additional or updated information, including more links to protein structures in the Protein Data Bank, compared with the previous release. The new entries include more examples from humans and several model organisms, more proteins involved in disease, and proteins with different combinations of functions. The updated web interface includes a search function using BLAST to enable users to search the database for proteins that share amino acid sequence similarity with a protein of interest. The updated website also includes additional background information about moonlighting proteins and an expanded list of links to published articles about moonlighting proteins.',\n",

       " 'The seed expressed gene DELAY OF GERMINATION (DOG) 1 is absolutely required for the induction of dormancy. Next to a non-dormant phenotype, the dog1-1 mutant is also characterized by a reduced seed longevity suggesting that DOG1 may affect additional seed processes as well. This aspect however, has been hardly studied and is poorly understood. To uncover additional roles of DOG1 in seeds we performed a detailed analysis of the dog1 mutant using both transcriptomics and metabolomics to investigate the molecular consequences of a dysfunctional DOG1 gene. Further, we used a genetic approach taking advantage of the weak aba insensitive (abi) 3-1 allele as a sensitized genetic background in a cross with dog1-1. DOG1 affects the expression of hundreds of genes including LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT and HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN genes which are affected by DOG1 partly via control of ABI5 expression. Furthermore, the content of a subset of primary metabolites, which normally accumulate during seed maturation, was found to be affected in the dog1-1 mutant. Surprisingly, the abi3-1 dog1-1 double mutant produced green seeds which are highly ABA insensitive, phenocopying severe abi3 mutants, indicating that dog1-1 acts as an enhancer of the weak abi3-1 allele and thus revealing a genetic interaction between both genes. Analysis of the dog1 and dog1 abi3 mutants revealed additional seed phenotypes and therefore we hypothesize that DOG1 function is not limited to dormancy but that it is required for multiple aspects of seed maturation, in part by interfering with ABA signalling components.',\n",
       " 'Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins, a group of hydrophilic proteins, have been linked to survival in plants and animals in periods of stress, putatively through safeguarding enzymatic function and prevention of aggregation in times of dehydration/heat. Yet despite decades of effort, the molecular-level mechanisms defining this protective function remain unknown. In this paper, we summarize and review research discoveries of the classification of the LEA protein groups based on their amino acid sequence similarity and on the presence of distinctive conserved motifs. Moreover, we focus on high correlation between their accumulation and water deficit, reinforcing their functional relevance under abiotic stresses. We also discuss the biochemical properties of LEA proteins arising from their hydrophilic nature and by amino acid composition. Although significant similarities have not been found between the members of the different groups, a unifying and outstanding feature of most of them is their high hydrophilicity and high content of glycine. Therefore, we have highlighted the biotechnological applications of LEA genes, and the effects of over-expressing LEA genes from all LEA groups from different species of origin into different plant hosts. Apart from agronomical purposes, LEA proteins could be useful for other biotechnological applications in relation to their capacity to prevent aggregation of proteins.']"

       "  'abstract': 'Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins comprise a diverse family whose members play a key role in abiotic stress tolerance. As intrinsically disordered proteins, LEA proteins are highly hydrophilic and inherently stress tolerant. They have been shown to stabilise multiple client proteins under a variety of stresses, but current hypotheses do not fully explain how such broad range stabilisation is achieved. Here, using neutron reflection and surface tension experiments, we examine in detail the mechanism by which model LEA proteins, AavLEA1 and ERD10, protect the enzyme citrate synthase (CS) from aggregation during freeze–thaw. We find that a major contributing factor to CS aggregation is the formation of air bubbles during the freeze–thaw process. This greatly increases the air–water interfacial area, which is known to be detrimental to folded protein stability. Both model LEA proteins preferentially adsorb to this interface and compete with CS, thereby reducing surface-induced aggregation. This novel surface activity provides a general mechanism by which diverse members of the LEA protein family might function to provide aggregation protection that is not specific to the client protein.'},\n",

This segregation allows AHs to adsorb at polar–apolar interfaces such as the lipid surfaces of cellular organelles. Using various examples, we discuss here how variations within this general scheme impart membrane-interacting AHs with different interfacial properties. Among the key parameters are: (i) the size of hydrophobic residues and their density per helical turn; (ii) the nature, the charge, and the distribution of polar residues; and (iii) the length of the AH. Depending on how these parameters are tuned, AHs can deform lipid bilayers, sense membrane curvature, recognize specific lipids, coat lipid droplets, or protect membranes from stress. Via these diverse mechanisms, AHs play important roles in many cellular processes.'},\n",

Such a study provides information about the effect of extreme environmental conditions on biological membranes and, in particular, on lipidic microdomains. Dehydration stress, indeed, is thought to cause both macroscopical damage and alterations of microdomains in biomembranes, leading to deleterious effects. These phenomena can be avoided if disaccharides are added during dehydration. In this work, we apply AFM imaging to directly visualize damage caused to supported lipid bilayers by water removal. We compare the efficiency of sucrose, trehalose, dextran, dimethyl sulfoxide, and glucose in preserving the structural integrity of domain-exhibiting model membranes. Finally, in addition to confirming previous findings, our results provide further insight into damage and alteration of microdomains in membranes as a consequence of stressful drying conditions.'},\n",

Several studies have attempted to understand how trehalose interacts with biomolecules. To address this problem, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of carboxy-myoglobin embedded in a trehalose aqueous solution and in a trehalose–water plasticized amorphous matrix.

Results obtained with infrared spectroscopy indicate that trehalose and DPPC interact by hydrogen bonding between the OH groups in the carbohydrate and the polar head groups of DPPC. These and previous results show that this hydrogen bonding alters the spacing of the polar head groups and may thereby decrease van der Waals interactions in the hydrocarbon chains of the DPPC. This interaction between trehalose and DPPC is specific to trehalose.

We focus on how LEAPs may protect a stress-susceptible proteome. These examples include instances of LEAPs providing a shield molecule function, possibly by instigating liquid-liquid phase separations. Some LEAPs bind directly to their client proteins, exerting a holdase-type chaperonin function. Finally, instances of LEAP–client protein interactions have been documented, where the LEAP modulates (interferes with) the function of the client protein, acting as a surreptitious rheostat of cellular homeostasis. From the examples identified to date, it is apparent that client protein modulation also serves to mitigate stress. While some LEAPs can physically bind and protect client proteins, some apparently bind to assist the degradation of the client proteins with which they associate. Documented instances of LEAP–client protein binding, even in the absence of stress, brings to the fore the necessity of identifying how the LEAPs are degraded post-stress to render them innocuous, a first step in understanding how the cell regulates their abundance.'},\n",

Strikingly, cellular stress is a strong inducer of the reversible membraneless compartments referred to as stress assemblies. Stress assemblies play key roles in survival during cell stress and in thriving of cells upon stress relief. The two best studied stress assemblies are the RNA‐based processing‐bodies (P‐bodies) and stress granules that form in response to oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), osmotic and nutrient stress as well as many others. Interestingly, P‐bodies and stress granules are heterogeneous with respect to both the pathways that lead to their formation and their protein and RNA content. Furthermore, in yeast and Drosophila, nutrient stress also leads to the formation of many other types of prosurvival cytoplasmic stress assemblies, such as metabolic enzymes foci, proteasome storage granules, EIF2B bodies, U‐bodies and Sec bodies, some of which are not RNA‐based.

Fluorescently-tagged Akt reporters have been used to discern Akt localisation, yet it has not been clear how well these tools recapitulate the behaviour of endogenous Akt proteins. Here, we observed that fusion of eGFP to Akt2 impaired both its insulin-stimulated plasma membrane recruitment and its phosphorylation. Endogenous-like responses were restored by replacing eGFP with TagRFP-T. The improved response magnitude and sensitivity afforded by TagRFP-T–Akt2 over eGFP–Akt2 enabled monitoring of signalling outcomes in single cells at physiological doses of insulin with subcellular resolution and revealed two previously unreported features of Akt biology. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, stimulation with insulin resulted in recruitment of Akt2 to the plasma membrane in a polarised fashion. Additionally, we observed oscillations in plasma membrane localised Akt2 in the presence of insulin with a consistent periodicity of 2\\u2005min. Our studies highlight the importance of fluorophore choice when generating reporter constructs and shed light on new Akt signalling responses that may encode complex signalling information.

There was considerable enhancement of the emission intensity with a large blue shift in emission and an absorption maximum at and above the sol—gel transition temperature (20 °C), showing the sensitivity of Nile red fluorescence to the sol—gel transition. The estimation of micropolarity by comparing the Nile red emission maximum in dioxane—water mixtures suggested a considerable decrease in the polarity of the PF127 microenvironment from less polar (20% dioxane—water) in its sol phase to almost non-polar (90% dioxane—water) microenvironments in the gel phase. The thermotropic response of the wavelength dependent fluorescence lifetime of the probe with a rise time in the longer wavelength region has enabled monitoring of the microheterogeneity of the gel medium. With an increase in temperature, the microviscosity progressively increases from ∼10 mPa s (sol state) to ∼23 mPa s (gel state). The mismatch between microviscosity as estimated by the Nile red and the corresponding bulk viscosity reflected the microheterogeneity of the pluronic medium and its sensitivity towards PF127 microenvironments.'},\n",

We found that a simple hydrophobic interaction column can mimic the selectivity of NPCs surprisingly well and that nuclear transport receptors appear to be the most hydrophobic soluble proteins. This suggests that surface hydrophobicity represents a major sorting criterion of NPCs. The rate of NPC passage of cargo–receptor complexes is, however, not dominated just by properties of the receptors. We found that large cargo domains drastically hinder NPC passage and require more than one receptor molecule for rapid translocation. This argues against a rigid translocation channel and instead suggests that NPC passage involves a partitioning of the entire translocating species into a hydrophobic phase, whereby the receptor:cargo ratio determines the solubility in that permeability barrier. Finally, we show that interfering with hydrophobic interactions causes a reversible collapse of the permeability barrier of NPCs, which is consistent with the assumption that the barrier is formed by phenylalanine‐rich nucleoporin repeats that attract each other through hydrophobic interactions.'},\n",

Better selectivity for cytoplasmic lipid droplets was obtained when the cells were viewed for yellow-gold fluorescence (excitation, 450-500 nm; emission, greater than 528 nm) rather than red fluorescence (excitation, 515-560 nm; emission, greater than 590 nm). Nile red-stained, lipid droplet-filled macrophages exhibited greater fluorescence intensity than did nile red- stained control macrophages, and the two cell populations could be differentiated and analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Such analyses could be performed with either yellow-gold or red fluorescence, but when few lipid droplets per cell were present, the yellow-gold fluorescence was more discriminating. Nile red exhibits properties of a near-ideal lysochrome. It is strongly fluorescent, but only in the presence of a hydrophobic environment.

To look at this, I wrote a script that would present me a random sample of abstracts with no classification so that I could manually classify them and get an idea of the distribution of true classification under the NOCLASS categroy. I did this for 50 abstracts (which is 0.1% of the papers with no classification, so really too small; but wanted to start here), let's take a look at the results."
